        <div class="storyText">
          <p>
            Somewhere in a certain Asian country, a peculiar streamer in the neighborhood
            is just done with his streaming work to focus on making something special. But
            he’s not just a usual streamer -- he claims to be the only streamer who is
            also a VTuber in the neighborhood.
          </p>
          <p>
            His past may be difficult, but he’s living his life trying to support fellow
            VTubers while he still can. He had remained committed to his passion for
            VTubing, among other activities, since his first contact with some of his
            friends on the internet -- who are also VTubers of various calibers.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’m almost done with this masterpiece, then I can finally tell the two
            special friends what I did in a year,” he said, drawing something on his
            phone. It appears to be an illustration of three VTubers whom he started
            working on at a shopping mall close to his home.
          </p>
          <p>
            On his laptop screen, there’s a 3D model that he’s somehow associated with a
            few years ago. Aside from that, two pictures were on the other side of his
            room, and behind him were items that could be described as ‘cosplay
            materials’.
          </p>
          <p>
            As he’s making the final gesture on his phone, so is his coloring of the
            layer. “It’s done,” he said. “Just in time for the scheduled debut.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Deeply breathing in and out, he prepares his voice, his materials, and his
            phone; as he presses the ‘Start Streaming’ button on his recording software.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Happy 1st Anniversary; mama dearest, mama queenie. May the Leaves,
            Nimbisouls, and Chuu-nins be upon us all.”
          </p>
