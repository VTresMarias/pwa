        <h2>Chapter 17: Leidram</h2>
        <div class="storyText">
          <p style="font-style: italic">A few days later…</p>
          <p>
            I was back at one of the gardens across the castle, where Hina had called me
            by my nickname for the first time. It somehow became nostalgic for me to
            remember that moment once in a while.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wearing an elegant robe given to me by the Royal Advisor, I finally fulfilled
            her wish of taking over her line of work.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">Rewind…</p>
          <p>
            “Everyone is waiting for you,” one of the maids said. “I don’t know about the
            future of this kingdom, but we wish you all the best.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Thanks,” I smile. “To be honest, I don’t know if I could fulfill her wish the
            moment she told me, but um…”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’m sure you can manage it! You can ask us for assistance should you need
            one,” another maid cheered on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just in time, the Royal Advisor handed me a box containing a robe of some
            sort. “As requested by the Oujo-sama,” he said.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carefully unboxing the robe, it has the color palette which is the same as the
            dress I’m currently wearing. It has white fur on the top part, and Sakura
            flowers knitted around the cloth. At the bottom, it has Hina’s name on it --
            which reads as “Hina-chuu”. On the inside, the body is colored pink as opposed
            to the red one on the outside. The etches were painted faint purple, as
            opposed to white. It also glitters when worn.
          </p>
          <p>“Thanks, I’ll see you all on the outside.”</p>
          <p>
            Later on, in front of the audience; the Royal Subjects, the maids and butlers,
            the Royal Advisor, and the Royal Bishop behind me; I gave out this speech at
            the castle balcony:
          </p>
          <p>
            “We gathered here today to remind ourselves about Oujo-sama&#39;s legacy and
            her desire to serve everyone through meaningful circumstances. She has served
            us faithfully and with utmost love to all. Today, I vow to continue on that
            legacy and fulfill her final wish -- that one wish that I never thought would
            come to me at an unexpected time. I aim to continue serving you all, until
            forever.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I close with the following words: “To Hina-chuu, who has been one of the most
            precious friends that I’ve ever met: I’m finally able to say that I’m proud to
            be your only Aga-chuu.”
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            Reaching for the top of my head, I can feel the weight of the tiara above me.
            “It’s custom-made, they said,” I thought to myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just then, I felt a strange blow of the wind around my back. Turning around, I
            saw a strange portal, which for some reason was the same portal back when Suzu
            decided to have a change of identity or some sort.
          </p>
          <p>
            Coming out of the portal is someone whom I haven’t seen in a long time. By
            appearance, she has a dress colored black and gold. She has short yellow hair,
            with an ahoge on it. By height, she appears petite. But her eyes…
          </p>
          <p>“Suzu?”</p>
          <p>She smiles, opening her arms. “I’m home.”</p>
          <p>
            Immediately, I pull her into an embrace, tears flowing from my eyes. “Welcome
            back! How have you been?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’m good! I’ve been through many reincarnations, but it would seem that all
            is worth it in the end.”
          </p>
          <p>“Glad you thought so.”</p>
          <p>
            “By the way,” she pulls out from the embrace. “I’m not Suzu anymore. Call me
            Emii -- Emii Shion.”
          </p>
          <p>“I see,” I nod. “Glad to meet you, Emii.”</p>
          <p>“You as well, Aga-chuu.”</p>
          <p>
            Slowly, another person came out of the portal. By height, it appears that
            she’s taller than both of us. By appearance, she appears in a quite revealing
            outfit, but her hair is long and silky -- in addition to some of it being
            colored blue, most of it is colored gold. She also wears a ‘floating’ crown
            above her head. Clothes-wise, she has quite the cape spanning regal palette
            and straight-line design. She also wields a sword to which I can’t determine
            its properties.
          </p>
          <p>
            “So it was you,” she said in a calm yet serious tone. “Glad to finally meet
            you, Agatha.”
          </p>
          <p>“So am I.”</p>
          <p>Slowly, she raises her hand towards my direction. “The note?”</p>
          <p>
            Slowly remembering I have the note in my pocket, I hesitantly gave it to her.
            She smiles for a bit, sending the note to thin air.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Let me formally introduce myself: My name is the Second King Arthur Leidram.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon realizing the name, I wander in pure curiosity and worry. She adds,
            “Don’t worry, I don’t mean you harm. I just want to thank you for what you’ve
            done to the kingdom.”
          </p>
          <p>“Don’t worry about it.”</p>
          <p>
            She frowns for a bit. “I can’t imagine what life has been like for you; unlike
            mine, who had her life full of despair and curse.”
          </p>
          <p>“I see.”</p>
          <p>
            Emii butts in, “Okay, I know you’ve been through a lot, but thanks for the
            introductions. Aga-chuu, I’ll hand over the note to you.”
          </p>
          <p>I accept Emii’s note, which contains the following:</p>
          <div class="ltrBox">
            <p>≈≈≈</p>
            <div class="noteTxt">
              <p>It’s the first time I get to write this note.</p>
              <p>
                So, first things first, I’m now on a mission to aid the people of Erden in
                their quest for… whatever they have in mind. It’ll be a long and intensive
                journey, but it sure was fun!
              </p>
              <p>
                I somehow met Gawain and Lancelot when I was wandering around Camelot, and
                to my surprise, I met Arthur Leidram. Such a stunning beauty, to say the
                least.
              </p>
              <p>
                But, something has been bugging me back when I first entered the portal: I
                don’t know what my main mission was.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, I decided to accompany Arthur on my way back here to hand you this
                note, because I’ll be staying there for a while. It’s been a painful
                decision to leave someone close to me behind, but we both know that we’ll
                get through this without a hitch.
              </p>
              <p>I hope for your support through these trying times.</p>
              <div class="noteClosing">
                <p>Emii Shion</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>≈≈≈</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            “Well,” I fold the note. “I heard some rumors from a faraway land that she was
            the so-called ‘Cursed Legend’, though it remains to be seen why that is the
            case.”
          </p>
          <p>“According to her, she did some… quite inexcusable things.”</p>
          <p>“Is that so?”</p>
          <p>“That’s what I was told.”</p>
          <p>“I see.”</p>
          <p>
            Sighing for a bit, I turn my attention to Arthur. “I would like to thank you
            for accompanying her on her trip here. Please take care of her well.”
          </p>
          <p>“I will,” she said with an accompanying bow.</p>
          <p>
            “Well, we should be going, then,” Emii said, turning to the portal. “May we
            meet again someday, Aga-chuu.”
          </p>
          <p>“Be safe, you two.”</p>
          <p>
            As I watched them enter the portal, one photo came down from above. The portal
            disappeared when the photo had hit the ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            Picking it up, it revealed a photo of Emii and Arthur in the frame, smiling in
            delight.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            Heading back to the castle, I join the maids and butlers as they share dinner
            together. I overheard their conversations concerning their personal lives, so
            I devised a directive that will let them take their time off to focus on their
            personal well-being. Same goes for the Royal Subjects and everyone working at
            the castle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Heading back to Hina’s room, I can’t wait to remove this robe and finally pass
            out for the night. It’s been a long and tedious journey back from the forest,
            but I finally found a place I can call ‘home’ -- a home that I can go back to
            whenever I feel like needing to.
          </p>
          <p>“Goodnight, Hina. Goodnight, Aura.”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>“It is done.”</p>
