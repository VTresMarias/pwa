        <h2>Chapter 2: Exit</h2>
        <div class="storyText">
          <p style="font-style: italic">Six days later…</p>
          <p>“I finally did it!”</p>
          <p>
            I finally made a single set of explosives. But… would they be worth it in the
            end? Would I be able to leave something that had been with me behind?
          </p>
          <p>
            Having those thoughts in my head, I immediately set off to have a glass of
            water inside the house. That’s where… she appeared in front of me, a glass of
            water in hand.
          </p>
          <p>“You must be very busy, Agatha,” she said as she pointed the glass to me.</p>
          <p>
            I immediately realized who she was after looking twice. “What brings you here,
            Grand Lady?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I can sense that you’re hard at work trying to move on, but you might still
            have some memories that you hold dear. For example, the photo frame of your
            Darling.”
          </p>
          <p>“...”</p>
          <p>
            She’s right. Despite my plans, I still have at least some memories that
            deserve to be cherished -- not destroyed. The memories I have with Darling,
            the music box from the kids’ room, my photo frame… and theirs.
          </p>
          <p>“Can… can I ask you a favor?”</p>
          <p>
            “I already know what your favor was. The Spirits will be here at any second.”
          </p>
          <p>
            As minutes go by, I start to notice that the items that were once in their
            places have disappeared. “The Spirits will take care of your things so that
            you don’t have to.”
          </p>
          <p>“Um… thanks.”</p>
          <p>
            Softly, she pats my head. “No worries, my dear. If it’s you, I can take up
            many favors at once.”
          </p>
          <p>“Oh, I won’t go that far.”</p>
          <p>She and I chuckle as we fill our stomachs with water.</p>
          <p>
            “It appears you still have more explosives to build,” she said, heading
            outside the house. “While parts of those memories will fade, a new memory will
            be put in their place. I hope you cherish that new memory that you have just
            attained.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I nod as she slowly walks out; a bright, shining light glittering the horizon
            before me.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            As I head back to the workshop, I continuously make the explosives, just
            enough to erase the oldest memories of the house.
          </p>
          <p>“Darling… I’m sorry. I failed you.”</p>
          <p>
            Teary-eyed as I am, I continue my work of making the explosives. By the end of
            the day, they were all finished, ready to be placed and detonated. I somehow
            devised a simple detonator during my work hours to prepare.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            Spare food was on the table. As I indulge in this dinner for the last time, my
            tears won’t stop flowing from my eyes. It seems that the more I eat alone, the
            more I remember them… the children that I’ve sacrificed during the deepest
            chill of winter.
          </p>
          <p>“My children… you are all the lucky ones…”</p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, I didn’t get to finish my dinner. I cried so hard and loud that
            it gradually forced me to sleep on the table.
          </p>
          <p>“I don’t deserve you all… I can’t…”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">Midnight…</p>
          <p>
            What I didn’t notice during my deep sleep is that the Spirits gather around
            me, illuminating themselves to provide me with warmth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inside my head, I can hear my children laughing as we run about during spring
            and autumn days. During summer, Darling and I brought our children to the
            beach; and although I was completely embarrassed by his choice of clothing, it
            still provided comfort and assurance that my beauty remains the same --
            unmatched and unrivaled.
          </p>
          <p>
            I didn’t notice that the Grand Lady was right behind me, ordering her Spirits
            to work. “Don’t worry, my precious Bearer… we’ve laid the groundwork for you
            to begin your lifelong journey into the outside world.”
          </p>
          <p>I still sleep soundly, so I assume I can’t hear them.</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            Morning. I didn’t realize that I was already in bed when I got up, explosives
            already prepared and wires laid about on the corners of the room.
          </p>
          <p>“Thanks, Grand Lady.”</p>
          <p>
            I took the final wash by the river which sits close to the house. I got some
            spare dresses and clothes just in case I need to change.
          </p>
          <p>
            Afterwards, I hastily pack my things in preparation for a new adventure.
            Sighing deeply, I put the bag aside as I wander around the house for one last
            time.
          </p>
          <p>“You will be missed dearly.”</p>
          <p>
            With a determined look, I pull the luggage outside, laying it far enough to
            not get caught by the intense shear of explosion. With the luggage laid over
            the grass, I turned to face the detonator placed just several meters away from
            the blast site. Heaving another sigh, I firmly grip the handle. “Just like
            what Darling taught me,” I thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gazing at the house as I about to push the lever down, I mutter the parting
            words:
          </p>
          <p>“Goodbye.”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            An intense feeling begins to shake up around my body as the air pushes
            through. Smoke and debris were seen from the safe area, with a few flying in
            the air. Fires begin to scorch the remains of the house.
          </p>
          <p>“The home… is no more.”</p>
          <p>
            Tears falling from my eyes, I smile for a bit, then turn away from the blast
            site. I know this isn’t the right way to part ways with something so memorable
            over the years, but I think this is for the best. To move on.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            As I made my way out of the forest and into civilization, I realized that I
            was now standing in the middle of the park. People of all ages gather around
            and are having fun with themselves. I smile, then turn to a family of five who
            were setting up a picnic.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cheers of the family members as they munch their snacks, that must have
            been beautiful~
          </p>
          <p>
            The father of the family looks at me with a curious expression. “How can I
            help you, young lady?”
          </p>
          <p>“Um, me?”</p>
          <p>
            “Yeah,” cues the mother. “You seem to be distraught. Is there something
            wrong?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “N- no,” I softly retaliated. “It’s just that I don’t know where the exit of
            this park is.”
          </p>
          <p>
            They both nod. The father replies, “I see. Well, you can go straight ahead
            from here. If you see a yellow gate to your left, go there -- that’s the park
            exit. Where are you going, by the way?”
          </p>
          <p>“Somewhere,” I murmur. “Anywhere.”</p>
          <p>
            “I see. I hope you end up somewhere nice,” the mother reassures. “It must be
            tough as a fellow mother, I guess.”
          </p>
          <p>“Yeah. I better go.”</p>
          <p>“Take care, miss.”</p>
          <p>As I head off from the family, I can hear them murmur about something.</p>
          <p>“Come to think of it, was she lost in the woods?” The mother asks.</p>
          <p>
            The father replies, “Maybe… maybe not. I heard there was once a mysterious
            house in the middle of the woods.”
          </p>
          <p>“Really?”</p>
          <p>
            “Yeah,” he nods. “In fact, during my visit to this park, I could hear a big
            explosion from the forest. I called for help, but there was no one around.
            Fortunately the smoke that came out of the explosion was significant and it
            made headlines across news outlets.”
          </p>
          <p>“I see. The woman came from the forest, yeah?”</p>
          <p>
            “Yup. It’s possible that either she was trapped in the woods during her trip
            with others, carrying their luggages; or that she once lived there for God
            knows how long.”
          </p>
          <p>“Hm.”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            The bustling roads ahead. Vehicles taking people to their destinations. And
            all the while, I fled out of the park.
          </p>
          <p>Carrying my luggage, I make my way to town, where my story begins.</p>
