        <div class="storyText">
          <p style="font-style: italic">Some time later…</p>
          <p>
            The gentle glow of the sun in a clear sky across a Sakura tree in the middle
            of the cool fields. A serene breeze seeping in as time passes by each moment.
            I slowly opened my eyes, realizing that I found myself in a completely
            different location this time.
          </p>
          <p>“This isn’t my room… where am I?”</p>
          <p>
            Trying to actually get up from what are essentially grass fields, I take a
            look around before realizing that there’s a box right next to me.
          </p>
          <p>“Where did this come from?”</p>
          <p>
            Gazing at the front, I saw a picnic table together with some chairs. Slowly
            heading to that location, I carefully inspect the box. “I wonder what’s inside
            this box,” I thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just as I was about to fully open the box, I heard the rustling sound of the
            grass as it closed in on my direction. Looking at the scene, I can see a
            figure from afar.
          </p>
          <p>“Wait, Aura?”</p>
          <p>
            Yes, the first to arrive is no other than Aura Ostara, the Celestial Nymph
            Guardian. She seems to be holding a green box.
          </p>
          <p>“Wait, Agatha dearest? What are you doing here?” Asks Aura.</p>
          <p>“I… I don’t know how I got here. But how are you as of late?”</p>
          <p>“Somehow I’m a bit… good.”</p>
          <p>
            Another figure started closing in. It was Hina Oujo this time. She shrieks
            mid-sentence, “Aura, are you sure this is the same spot… hold on. Aga-chuu?”
          </p>
          <p>“Hina-chuu? How did you get here?”</p>
          <p>“I… I don’t know, I was following Aura the whole time.”</p>
          <p>
            On Hina’s hand is a pink box. Respectively, I have a purple box, which seems
            to be heavier.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hold on, Aga-chuu… we talked about the box before, right?” Hina began the
            conversation. “So, what would it mean that three boxes need to be together to
            find the ‘key’?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Um… Hina, let’s not bombard her with questions yet,” Aura tries to calm her
            down.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s okay, Aura,” I tap her shoulder, looking at Hina. “I’ll tell you
            everything after we’ve unboxed the items.”
          </p>
          <p>Both nod in agreement, and started opening the boxes together with me.</p>
          <p>
            Hina’s box contains three bracelets of varying colors, where those match the
            color of respective boxes. In addition, she has a photo frame; and three pins
            with varying symbols: Leaf, Lotus, and Sakura.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aura’s box contains three choker necklaces, with colors the same as on the
            bracelets. It also has two crowns, and one DSLR camera for some reason.
          </p>
          <p>
            My box contains a quill pen, three rings engraving different symbols, and a
            book of some sort. “I wonder what’s inside this book,” I ponder.
          </p>
          <p>
            While we are discussing what made these items connected with each other,
            another peculiar figure has arrived. “Glad to see the three of you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “So do we,” Aura and Hina greeted back. I nod as I immediately get up from my
            seat holding a book. It appears the Grand Lady already gave me the signal as
            soon as the book was out of the bag.
          </p>
          <p>
            Approaching the Grand Lady, I observe as my hands feel a little warm sensation
            with the book in full glow.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It is done,” she said, her hands away from the book. “The rest is up to you.”
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            Turning to Aura and Hina, I can feel myself slowly bursting to tears as I
            begin to recall the memories I had with them in my head. “I… I…”
          </p>
          <p>
            About to break down to tears, they responded with a warm embrace, making sure
            to let all my feelings out.
          </p>
          <p>
            A while later, I gently held their hand as I begin to mutter the following
            words:
          </p>
          <p>
            “Aura… I know we met for a short while, but it was one of the most fulfilling
            experiences I’ve ever had in my entire life. I can safely say that you’re the
            first precious friend that I ever dreamed to have since getting out of my
            shell. It felt like an eternity just being able to be close to you, even when
            there are some times that we needed to be apart. And Hina… you have this kind
            of magic that draws me in and becomes one of your support people. We shared
            the same laughs, the same circumstances; and most importantly, we’re able to
            get things done together. I may not feel you physically when you left the
            kingdom, but your presence not only reached me but every Chuu-nins out there.
            And I vowed to keep on the promise we made under the Sakura tree, that once
            you depart, I’ll do whatever I can to keep the spirit alive.”
          </p>
          <p>Aura and Hina burst to tears in response.</p>
          <p>
            “Aga-chuu,” Hina responded with a smile on her face. “I never thought that you
            thought of us quite so well.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I,” Aura hiccuped during her sentence. “I don’t know what to say. I know it’s
            been a short while that we’re together, but your soul has reached me and the
            Nimbisouls. I can’t thank you enough for making me feel that way.”
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">A while later…</p>
          <p>Standing in front of the three, I begin my salutations:</p>
          <p>
            “So, what’s on the table are what we will represent, and what essentially will
            be the ‘signal’ to our future endeavors. But first, let me distribute these
            items to the both of you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Sorting the items by color and symbol, I first gave Aura a Lotus-shaped tiara.
            In addition: A green choker necklace, a Lotus pin, a green bracelet, and a
            Lotus-designed ring.
          </p>
          <p>
            I gave Hina the crown next, which is almost identical as the one she’s
            currently wearing, but even shinier than before. In addition: A pink bracelet
            and choker necklace, a Sakura-designed ring, and a Sakura pin.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got the bracelet and choker necklace colored purple, a Leaf pin, and a
            Leaf-designed ring. I’m not sure about the headwear since I don’t have a crown
            myself. But looking at the Grand Lady, she seems to have the necklace
            prepared. “So that explains that I didn’t feel anything after a fight with the
            delinquents; my necklace had disappeared.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking at both of them, I nodded and gave the following command: “With all
            the items in place, let’s all wear them at once.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In a simultaneous manner; Aura, Hina, and I begin to wear the items as
            indicated. One by one, the pins start to glow, along with its corresponding
            ring. Some seconds later, the glow disappeared.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Very well,” the Grand Lady steps in, holding a book and a quill pen. “Aura
            and Hina, please step forward.”
          </p>
          <p>
            As they’re told, the two make their step as the book begins to flip the pages
            by itself. “This book will be the testament of what the future endeavors will
            bring. Signing here will put your name on everyone’s hearts moving forward.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Hina immediately takes the pen right after the Grand Lady finishes her
            statement. “For the Chuu-nins… and for Aga-chuu.” Immediately, she signs her
            name on the page, handing the pen over to Aura.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aura nervously takes the pen from Hina’s hand, closing her eyes. “It seems
            that what we’ll be doing at this point onward will reflect on everyone’s
            wishes and desires. And as someone who longed for someone dearest to me, I
            think I already made the right choice. For Agatha dearest.”
          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as Aura finishes signing on the page, the pen slowly floats to my
            direction. “The key is yours, Bearer,” the Grand Lady said.
          </p>
          <p>
            I nod, raising my hand; causing the book to float towards my direction. I turn
            away, walking towards the Sakura tree as I take deep breaths. I then mutter
            the following words:
          </p>
          <p>
            “Universality without Borders. Acceptance beyond Comprehension. May these two
            core values unite us all.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Turning back to face the three from afar, I slowly write my signature on the
            page. As soon as I finish the signature, the book begins to glow even brighter
            with the quill pen disappearing from my hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It is settled,” cues the Grand Lady. “Aura and Hina, please join her in this
            ceremony.”
          </p>
          <p>
            They both nod, tears in their eyes, as they approach forward. I smiled as they
            gave me another warm embrace.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            “Aura; for your dedication to find what’s unique and precious inside one’s
            soul, I hereby commend you as the Second Maria.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Aura ascends, her hands on her chest. “As the Second Maria, I’m ready to
            tackle any challenges together with you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I turn to face Hina. “Hina; for your continuous support and love throughout
            the trying times, and for not giving up your spirit for the greater good, I
            hereby commend you as the Third Maria.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Hina ascends, her hands on her chest as she smiles with her eyes closed. “I’m
            personally grateful to have met you on that day. As the Third Maria, I swore
            to carry on the promise we made together.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I stood firm, my hands on my chest. “Then, as the First Maria, I look forward
            to sharing all the precious moments with both of you.”
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            The Grand Lady walks in with a necklace in her hands. “In order to formally
            commence the Collective of your choice, you must wear this necklace for one
            last time.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I gently take the necklace, wearing it around my neck. With my head facing the
            sky, I begin to chant the following words:
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh Luna, come to me and heed my call; for the First Maria is here to serve
            you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Closing my eyes, I can feel my body heating up as I begin to change my
            appearance. Somehow, the necklace disappeared before I knew it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Grand Lady, Aura, and Hina watched in awe as my clothing began to change.
            From afar, the spirits from the Celestial Tree began to swirl around,
            combining into a ball of light.
          </p>
          <p>
            A moment later, the light had disappeared, and the view returned to normal. I
            slowly descend from the air, facing the three. “The Oracle has been sealed,” I
            said, noticeably realizing that I changed my voice once more.
          </p>
          <p>
            By appearance, it still appears the same as the first time I had this
            experience -- even though I only had it twice during those times. Clothing
            remains the same, but more regal than ever. Instead of a tiara, I have a
            floating crown that’s shaped like the sun and moon -- partly reminiscent of
            Arthur’s.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Aura and Hina, what you’re looking at right now is her enhanced ‘Luna’ form.
            She resembles the ‘Goddess of Moonlight’ -- constituting the ‘Moon’,” the
            Grand Lady said. “But despite everything, she’s still the same Agatha that you
            know and love.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Turning her gaze to mine, she adds, “Agatha, have you made up a name that will
            represent the three of you?”
          </p>
          <p>
            To this, I nod, “Yes. With the three of us committed to making the world a
            better place for everyone, and how we refer ourselves as Marias; I’m now proud
            to proclaim the name of the Collective:
            <b>VTresMarias. V三人のマリア (rom. bui san’nin no maria).</b>”
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            “Very well,” the Grand Lady nods, raising her arms. As she raises her head to
            gaze at the skies, she slowly begins to float in the air -- wings open wide,
            her body glowing.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Mother Agatha. By the power of the Celestial Tree, and the grace of yours
            truly -- the Grand Lady, I hereby bless thee upon the eternal grace of those
            who lived within. May the Leaves, Nimbisouls, and Chuu-nins be upon you --
            VTresMarias.”
          </p>
          <p>
            As the Grand Lady ascended to the skies, I was reverted back to my original
            form as we watched the grace unfold before our eyes.
          </p>
          <p>The Grand Lady begins to chant like an angel in the sky:</p>
          <p>
            “Mother Agatha, the First Maria. Bearing the essence of the Leaf --
            symbolizing ‘Perseverance’. You aim to be at your best and you keep going
            forward to achieve your dreams and goals with the support of many -- whilst
            continuing to support those who you cherished. Aura Ostara, the Second Maria.
            Bearing the essence of the Lotus -- symbolizing ‘Rebirth’. You learn from your
            past and adapt to changes around and within you, in conjunction for what will
            be your own future. Hina Oujo, the Third Maria. Bearing the essence of the
            Sakura -- symbolizing ‘Stability’. Learning how to align and distance yourself
            remains one of the key factors in defining your personality, though it’s for
            the best once in a while. Considering your associations with people remains a
            necessity to keep oneself sane and tranquil.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Aura, Hina, and I chant together for the first time: “Universality without
            Borders. Acceptance beyond Comprehension.”
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            The Grand Lady descended a while after such a proclamation, a camera in hand.
            “Everyone, prepare to make your mark in this world.”
          </p>
          <p>
            We all nod at the request, finding what pose would be suitable. When we’re
            done, I signal the Grand Lady to take a photo of a lifetime.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a click of the shutter, there it was: Three ladies -- sisters -- sitting
            under the shade of the Sakura tree as we begin our lifelong journey as the
            ‘Marias’.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            With her hands, the Grand Lady began to manipulate the photo frame to make it
            larger than it originally was, while also duplicating to make other two
            iterations. The photo, surprisingly enlarged, fits right through it without a
            hitch. Mastered to perfection, the Grand Lady’s graceful hands did all the
            heavy lifting to ensure that the photo is preserved for a long time, just like
            our legacy together.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a final sigh, she lifts her hands in the air, causing the two photo
            frames to levitate and vanish. “I wonder where they would end up,” Aura
            ponders throughout the process.
          </p>
          <p>Hina shrugs, “Who knows.”</p>
          <p>I could only smile and gaze at the sky. “I hope they like it.”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">At Hina’s castle…</p>
          <p>
            The butlers aided in carrying a large photo frame covered in opaque silk. By
            the Royal Advisor’s directive, it needs to be placed at a wall facing the
            entrance doors.
          </p>
          <p>“Just put it right there,” he said, a note in his hand.</p>
          <p>
            When the butlers were done, they begin accompanying the maids as they arrange
            their standing positions as the Royal Advisor begins to read his note:
          </p>
          <p>
            “Today, we could not believe that the day would come, that two souls will
            become one with grace and honor. Yes; our liege, our Oujo-sama; and our Royal
            Accomplice, Aga-chuu -- have officially bonded together with someone named
            Aura Ostara… to form a collective in which they enforce the following core
            values: ‘Universality without Borders’, ‘Acceptance beyond Comprehension’. And
            to this, I officially state that I’m very proud to become one of the
            Chuu-nins.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The drape has finally come off, revealing the portrait of the trios -- the
            Marias under the Sakura tree in a place far far away. The Royal Advisor
            concludes, “Today, we formally recognize the Royal Trios -- VTresMarias.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In the following days that follow, the castle became one of the biggest
            tourist attractions across the kingdom and beyond. The Royal Advisor,
            currently assigned as the tour guide, gave the onlookers a history of how it
            was established following Hina’s arrival, and how it’s currently thriving
            under Agatha’s rule.
          </p>
          <p>
            The two maids that have been close to Hina for a long time were occupying both
            rooms respectively, preparing the rooms in advance for the two’s return in the
            future.
          </p>
          <p>
            The subjects -- Chuu-nins -- were living their days as if the spirits of the
            Marias were with them. The boarding house became a multifunction hall, where
            guests from around the world would chat and share their experiences while
            being catered by good food served by former tenants -- who became its own
            employees.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">At the Incorporeal Garden…</p>
          <p>
            Most of the spirits gather together outside the Fun House as the package
            begins to arrive. It’s so large, many spirits help to carry the package
            inside.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the senior spirits who have been running the Garden since their
            Guardian was out of duty for a long time gave out the following speech:
          </p>
          <p>
            “Today, we celebrate a major milestone here in the Incorporeal Garden as our
            Celestial Nymph Guardian -- Aura Ostara -- takes on a bigger opportunity
            together with who’s essentially her first friend in a lifetime. Together with
            another accomplice of theirs, let’s all celebrate the coming of the collective
            abided by their core values: ‘Universality without Borders’, and ‘Acceptance
            beyond Comprehension’. As one of the senior spirits of the Incorporeal Garden,
            and as a proud Nimbisoul, I’m proud to present: VTresMarias!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The drape has been let go, revealing the picture of the Marias to the
            audience. The Lotuses that were prepared in advance begin to light up in
            colors of purple, green, and pink; signifying the ceremonial inauguration of
            the Marias.
          </p>
          <p>
            The spirits -- now called Nimbisouls -- are happily celebrating and chanting
            to the tune. The Garden had become livelier than it was before Agatha arrived
            for the first time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, inside Aura’s personal garden, three tiaras were being built from
            lively branches to be prepared in anticipation of the trio’s arrival.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            Aura, Hina, and I witness as the photo frame is being lifted to the supposed
            giant signage. The Grand Lady has been doing the heavy lifting for quite long.
          </p>
          <p>“And… it’s done,” she said. “That should do it.”</p>
          <p>
            Hina felt astonished upon looking at the frame again. “That’s… beautiful.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I agree,” Aura nods in agreement. “The three of us look wonderful in there.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I could only think of all possible actions after this ceremony. Should we go
            out to see the world together? Or should we make our own art for the sake of
            eliminating boredom while we’re here in this world? Or should we change
            clothes for a change of pace?
          </p>
          <p>Well, I could only hope for the best for us.</p>
          <p>
            “I must go now,” the Grand Lady backs away. “The Celestial Tree needs my
            presence.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “No worries,” I smile at her. “Thanks for gathering all three of us here.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “The fate of the world now lies in your hands now,” she said, gazing at the
            sky. “May I hope that you continue your journey with the ones you loved moving
            forward.”
          </p>
          <p>“I swore to protect her the first time we met,” Aura nods.</p>
          <p>
            “I’ll do whatever it takes to serve the people just like what Aga-chuu did,”
            Hina follows suit.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You can assure us, Grand Lady, that we’ll do whatever we can to make this
            world a better place,” I said. “That’s the promise I swore to myself.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Very well,” the Grand Lady nods, a portal opening behind her. “Go forth and
            beyond, Marias, for the adventure awaits.”
          </p>
          <p>
            We just watch as she makes her final exit, back to the sanctum where the
            Celestial Tree stands proud in the center of the moonlight lake. As the portal
            closes for the final time, we both sigh in relief and uncertainty.
          </p>
          <p>“So… what’s next?” Hina asks. “Should we go back to my place?”</p>
          <p>“Wait,” I halt. “Is that a bit too early? Are you tired?”</p>
          <p>Aura begins to yawn. “Now that you mention it, I kinda am.”</p>
          <p>
            The sun has already set, the moon shining above us. “Welp, I guess you’re
            right,” Hina scratches her eyes. “But where should we call it a night?”
          </p>
          <p>
            I gaze at the illuminating Sakura tree and smile. “I guess I found the perfect
            location.”
          </p>
          <p>
            All three of us walk hand-in-hand as the cold breeze seeps in through our
            bodies. Sitting on the grass fields, we both chatted about our stories
            regarding our origins and how we became our own selves.
          </p>
          <p>
            When all of us became tired, we immediately lay over the grass as we gaze at
            the stars. “You know, I dreamed of it some time ago,” Aura continued the
            conversation.
          </p>
          <p>“Really?” Hina responded. “Tell us about it.”</p>
          <p>“I mean, I already told it to Agatha dearest, so…”</p>
          <p>
            I chuckle. “Yeah, it was at one point that you invited us to lay down on the
            grass under the shade of the tree, with all the Leaves, Lotuses, and Sakuras
            around us, Hina.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I think this might be just like what you dreamed about,” Hina told Aura. “But
            we’ve been called the Marias before this happened.”
          </p>
          <p>“I think that’s a part of it.”</p>
          <p>
            As we gaze back at the night sky, the stars begin to align, forming our
            symbols. The lines are of three colors associated with our palette.
          </p>
          <p>
            Somehow, Aura and Hina begin to sleep soundly as we hear the tranquil sounds
            of nature. Their arms were over my stomach, so that I could barely move. They
            both feel comfortable, though.
          </p>
          <p>
            I could only gaze at the sky for one last time as the colors began to dim.
            Smiling, I bid both of them goodnight.
          </p>
          <p>“Goodnight, Aura. Goodnight, Hina. My precious Marias.”</p>
          <p>
            From this day onward, a new collective was born from the friendship of three
            personalities spanning different places and generations. A collective that
            will become a staple in all the ups and downs of what makes a friendship
            frugal, yet so great.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the Marias drown themselves in their deep sleep, their bond continues to
            tighten. I could only hope for better days with them… those who I cherished
            the most.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dream that I wished for for so long has finally borne fruit, and I remain
            to stay with them… forever.
