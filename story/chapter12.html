        <h2>Chapter 12: Coronation</h2>
        <div class="storyText">
          <p>
            The Coronation Day has arrived. Immediately, I get out of bed, only to realize
            that the maids are waiting for me outside the room.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Agatha-sama, your carriage is waiting,” they said. “Oujo-sama departed early
            to meet with the subjects and to prepare for the ceremony.”
          </p>
          <p>I nod, following the maids to the carriage as they declared.</p>
          <p>
            As we wandered around the vicinity, I saw children placing assortments of
            flowers along the sidewalk. Alongside that, their parents were busy cooking
            some delicious delicacies as they prepared some clothes to be used during the
            Coronation.
          </p>
          <p>
            At some point, Hina’s carriage stopped at a nearby flower store as the owner
            gave her some exquisite flowers in exchange for a few pins made from the Royal
            Jewellers. I guess Hina’s really popular all over the place, even when she’s
            not a Queen yet.
          </p>
          <p>
            I then remember the first time that she told me about the “favor” to which I
            accepted dearly. To be honest, even after I made my decision, I still don’t
            know if I would be able to keep up with her pace considering how dynamic she
            is in terms of her workloads.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’m sure she’s looking forward to working with you fully,” one of the maids
            said with a smile on her face. “She can be serious at times, but she’s doing
            her best to make us all feel at ease. Even after what had just happened to us,
            she shrugged it off like it’s no big deal. That goes to show how easy she is
            when you begin to realize how fun it is to work for her.”
          </p>
          <p>I sigh in relief. “Yeah… I hope it stays there.”</p>
          <p>
            As we head back to the castle, we see a number of people inside the castle
            preparing some things. “I actually have a little question,” I blurt out.
          </p>
          <p>“Yes?”</p>
          <p>I turned to the maid who responded to my query. “Where is… Ouji-sama?”</p>
          <p>
            “Oh,” she fiddles her fingers. “He’s at the chapel helping with stuff. If you
            want, we can introduce you to him.”
          </p>
          <p>“Please do.”</p>
          <p>
            As we head to the chapel as per my request, we encounter the Royal Bishop, as
            well as a few others who were cleaning up the chapel. I turn my attention to
            the Ouji-sama, who’s in the middle of shining the crown and scepter to be used
            at the Coronation.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ouji-sama,” I bow in front of him following the greeting. He seems pleased.
          </p>
          <p>
            “So you must be the Royal Guest that Oujo-sama was talking about,” he said in
            a calm tone. “Nice to meet you.”
          </p>
          <p>“So do I.”</p>
          <p>
            “The Coronation should begin in a few moments,” he said. “We’re almost ready
            here at the chapel. I’m almost done with shining the scepter to be used during
            the Coronation.”
          </p>
          <p>“Very well,” I nod. “Please take care of yourself after the event.”</p>
          <p>“You too.”</p>
          <p>
            As we head out of the chapel, the trumpets begin to tune, signaling that the
            Coronation is just moments away.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I think we’re ready,” I said. Tending to the dress that Hina gave me, I pull
            the pins from the pocket, and put them on the topmost-right part of the
            bodice.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">Moments later…</p>
          <p>
            The maids and I are on the front row seat as the Royal Bishop enters the
            podium. Putting the Holy Bible on top of it, he begins his Coronation speech.
            Everyone stood to pledge their allegiance to the Queen, to which I
            participated as well -- not noticing that the Sakura pin faintly started to
            glow.
          </p>
          <p>
            The parade started afterwards -- with everyone gazing backwards to witness the
            coming of the Queen. The Hina that I first saw a few days ago was glittering
            in her regal black dress. There’s a crown on her head, though I’m not sure
            what it&#39;s for. Would it interfere with the new crown that she’s about to
            wear?
          </p>
          <p>
            She stops for a bit, looking to the right -- where the Ouji-sama was waiting
            along the aisle. Arms linked, they continue walking to the podium.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Royal Bishop then takes the crown from its place, and slowly places it
            over her head -- signifying that a new Queen has been reigned. “All hail
            Hina!”
          </p>
          <p>Everyone chanted afterwards, “All hail Hina!”</p>
          <p>
            Handing the pillow to her direction, he instructed her to carry the scepter.
            Facing the audience, she proclaimed in a serious but confident tone: “I hereby
            pledge to the Oath of the Holy Bible to protect the people to whom I
            cherished. In accordance; I, Hina Oujo, begin my duties as the newly-crowned
            Queen.”
          </p>
          <p>
            From then, I realized that the glow began to intensify, so I tried to cover it
            off with my hand. She notices the ordeal, but then realizes after a full
            minute of fixating with the audience that her pin -- for some unknown reason I
            realized was in there in the first place -- also began to glow.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the cheers went on, so was the applause from inside the chapel. I’m a bit
            nervous, though.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the party came and went without issues. I opted to head out to bed
            early as I need to check on a few things before I start my job as her Royal
            Accomplice.
