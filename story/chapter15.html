        <h2>Chapter 15: Suzu</h2>
        <div class="storyText">
          <p style="font-style: italic">Some time later…</p>
          <p>
            I got out of bed like usual, and was gearing up for a new day as a Royal
            Accomplice when everyone started to panic.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hurry down the hallway as the Maids begin weeping. “What just happened?” I
            asked.
          </p>
          <p>“She… Hina,” one of the maids softly spoke.</p>
          <p>“Hina? What happened to her?”</p>
          <p>
            Looking around the hallway, I somehow encountered an unusual human walking up
            the stairs. She sports long, yellow hair and a clothing set similar to a
            penguin -- including its hat.
          </p>
          <p>
            One maid slowly approaches, a letter in her hand. “Aga-chuu, Oujo-sama wanted
            to give this to you.”
          </p>
          <p>“Thanks,” I acknowledged. The following letter reads:</p>
          <div class="ltrBox">
            <p>≈≈≈</p>
            <div class="noteTxt">
              <p>Aga-chuu,</p>
              <p>
                I deeply apologize for my sudden absence, but something came up in my
                hometown that I was required to be there as soon as possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’m well aware that my absence would cause concern within the community,
                but I’ve decided for the best that someone had to look out for everyone
                while I’m out of the picture.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’ve also authorized one of my trusted individuals to take my place for
                the meantime. Her name is Suzu Puyotori.
              </p>
              <p>
                But don’t worry -- you will and ALWAYS will remain as a Royal Accomplice,
                a Grand Overseer that will ensure that everything is in order.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’ve also talked to the Royal Subjects the day before my sudden absence to
                assume responsibility just in case I’m out of the picture. Operations will
                continue as normal for now, but I’ll exclusively let you know when things
                arise.
              </p>
              <p>
                And oh, I also took the box with me in case you were wondering. I just
                felt like I also needed to check out the items during my leave.
              </p>
              <p>
                Anyway, I hope that we’ll meet again someday. I may be out for a while,
                but always remember that I’m always with you wherever you go.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please take care of yourself, and don’t let negativities surround you,
                okay? You are our last hope in this momentous endeavor.
              </p>
              <p>And with it, I leave the responsibilities to you.</p>
              <div class="noteClosing">
                <p>Hina-chuu</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>≈≈≈</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            “Sounds like there’s something important going on back home,” I contemplated.
            Looking at the maids, I declare: “Okay then, you all should take your time off
            for the time being. I know everyone is a bit emotional over what had just
            happened, but she will return before we know it. I’ll take it from here and
            talk to Suzu.”
          </p>
          <p>
            As the maids nod and leave the scene, I head back upstairs to find Suzu
            looking at the window. “I don’t know if I can do it right.”
          </p>
          <p>“Um, Suzu?” I softly call up to her.</p>
          <p>
            Slowly, she turns around to look at my gaze. “Would I be able to deal with
            it?”
          </p>
          <p>
            I sigh, walking on the bed with a smile on my face. “That is, if you are
            willing to take it. Look, I’ve heard of you through Hina, but I’m pretty sure
            that you’ll do just fine. If you need just anything, don’t hesitate to lend me
            a hand.”
          </p>
          <p>Slowly, Suzu began to smile. I find that very cute.</p>
          <p>“You have such cute clothing,” I compliment.</p>
          <p>She giggles, reaching out to pat my head. “Thanks. What’s your name?”</p>
          <p>“Mother Agatha. You can call me Aga-chuu.”</p>
          <p>
            “Aga-chuu,” she keeps repeating my nickname in her head. “That’s a cute name.”
          </p>
          <p>I blushingly smile, patting her head.</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            The next day, I encountered Suzu again in the hallway as she’s talking to the
            maids and the Royal Subjects. Everyone welcomed her with open arms, and
            they’re looking forward to spending the next several moments with her.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You must be exhausted,” I said to her as she approached my direction. “But
            how did it go?”
          </p>
          <p>“More than great, I guess,” she grins. “I can’t wait to meet the others.”</p>
          <p>“You will, soon.”</p>
          <p>
            The following weeks passed and the subjects began wondering about the
            substitute Queen. Following the Royal Advisor’s advice, I decided to leave the
            castle for the time being. With it, I headed back to the boarding house that I
            first resided in.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tenants that first accompanied me during my time there welcomed me with
            open arms. We began sharing stories of what happened, and how the tenants
            found me at the Coronation. I couldn’t help but giggle at their responses, as
            they were the first few friends that I met after what happened with Aura.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You’re already the talk of the town every day,” one tenant said with a smile
            on her face. “We can’t believe that you were immediately appointed as a part
            of her slate. Tell me, have you both been friends before?”
          </p>
          <p>“Something like that.”</p>
          <p>
            “We just got caught up with Oujo-sama’s departure,” another tenant added. “For
            the record, I also asked her about what had happened. ‘Something came up’, she
            said, holding a box of some sort.”
          </p>
          <p>“That could be the box that I was anticipating,” I thought.</p>
          <p>
            “Then the last thing I indicated was the woosh of a spaceship just a few miles
            from here,” she continued the conversation. “In the end, we couldn’t figure
            out what was in that box.”
          </p>
          <p>“I see.”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">A while later…</p>
          <p>
            “Suzu-sama was waiting for you,” one of the maids entered the boarding house.
            “Aga-chuu, she needs to talk to you about certain things.”
          </p>
          <p>“Alright, wait a moment.”</p>
          <p>
            Facing the tenants, I gave them some flowers as farewell gifts. “Don’t worry,
            I’ll be here again.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Bidding their goodbyes, I head back to the castle where Suzu was waiting. She
            appears to be holding something in her hands.
          </p>
          <p>“Welcome back,” she pulls me into an embrace. “Here.”</p>
          <p>“This is,” I examine the item. “A penguin hat?”</p>
          <p>“Yeah. I made it myself,” she giggles. “I hope you like it!”</p>
          <p>
            Carefully wearing it on my head, I can feel the softness from the materials as
            it caresses against my skin. This, combined with the fact that Suzu
            single-handedly made the whole thing herself, made my heart flutter.
          </p>
          <p>“Okay then, let’s get inside.”</p>
          <p>
            The moments that follow were not that much eventful, aside from a few things:
          </p>
          <p>
            A week after Suzu gave me the hat, I got two letters from the maids, all
            containing the names of Saha Kyuri and Cayena Hakaba. While reading them, one
            maid stepped into my room, holding another couple of letters. “It’s from
            someone named Ainne and Skydarc.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Carefully reading the letters with the maid, they all convey similar
            intentions of visiting the place to see Suzu.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Okay,” I nod. “I’ll forward these to her right away. In turn, keep an ear out
            for my signal.”
          </p>
          <p>“Understood.”</p>
          <p>
            After relaying to Suzu the letters, she gave a thumbs-up, telling me to write
            the replies indicating her approval of entry. Looking at her gestures, I can
            see that she had some experience in these affairs. Checking one of the
            notebooks under the table, it revealed that Hina had written down notes on how
            to run the kingdom just in case she departs.
          </p>
          <p>
            “To Suzu,” I read the cover of the notebook. I thought, “I see… She wants to
            teach Suzu on how things work around here one way or another.”
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">Two weeks later…</p>
          <p>
            “Milady, they have arrived,” one of the maids told me as I walked down the
            stairs. Together with the Royal Subjects, I personally met the four visitors
            one by one. “Pleased to meet you all,” I greet with a smile on my face.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suzu came down afterwards, taking her time to meet what would essentially be
            her colleagues. Saha handed me a letter, addressed to Suzu from a company
            called Aurora. Reading the note, I expressed enthusiasm and support for the
            group that they’re participating in.
          </p>
          <p>
            For some reason, however, I started to look at Suzu in a different light; like
            it’s trying to tell me that Hina’s spirit still lingers within her. I close my
            eyes and let my mind wander, “Hina, I know that you’re always everywhere
            whether I’m in the kingdom or not. I hope that whatever path we both tackle,
            will take us to wherever we need to go.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Suzu gazes at the air-headed me, wondering what I was thinking. But she smiles
            as she gets back to the conversation.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">Two months later…</p>
          <p>“... and with this, I hope you can support me in my endeavors!”</p>
          <p>
            Everyone across the kingdom witnessed as Suzu made her speech on the podium.
            Now that Suzu is ruling the place on behalf of Hina, I’m hoping that she’ll be
            able to run things smoothly in the long run.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the days that follow, Suzu reached out to the Royal Subjects for advice. In
            addition, Saha and Cayena -- among others -- also helped out. In some
            instances, Suzu joined in on the fun -- performing together with others on a
            stage in front of the castle.
          </p>
          <p>
            But despite the experiences, I observe that Suzu has been deteriorating over
            time. I called in the doctor to check up on her, and it revealed that her
            health conditions have been deteriorating. Worried sick, I advised her to take
            concurrent breaks to prevent overworking.
          </p>
          <p>
            The days that follow had everyone worried about Suzu, not to mention what has
            happened with Hina following her departure.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            After 18 days, Suzu has decided that she’ll be stepping down as the ruler of
            the kingdom, as well as her departure from Aurora. Everyone around the kingdom
            is devastated by such news.
          </p>
          <p>
            I myself held onto her hand, asking for her to stay strong. Suzu softly
            smiles, looking at me with worrisome eyes. “Don’t worry, as long as I’m still
            breathing, I’ll continue to help you in these trying times.”
          </p>
          <p>“B- but…”</p>
          <p>“I hope to be your acquaintance from now on, Aga-chuu.”</p>
          <p>
            I learned from this that despite the short moments that have occurred during
            her time as a ruler, she still shines like the sun beaming above us. This has
            caused me to shift my focus to aiding in any effort with the best I can -- a
            promise I made with Hina under the rustling Cherry Blossom trees.
