        <h2>Chapter 3: Fates</h2>
        <div class="storyText">
          <p>
            A bustling town full of vigor and warmth. People hustling from all directions
            just to do their own things. Somehow, it gave me nostalgia.
          </p>
          <p>“When was the last time I’ve been here?”</p>
          <p>
            As I walk around the sidewalk, I somehow turn to face the convenience store.
            With very little money left in my pocket, I head inside to buy a bottle of
            water.
          </p>
          <p>“Here’s the item, ma’am,” I said as I placed the bottle on the counter.</p>
          <p>“Thanks. By the way, are you traveling somewhere?”</p>
          <p>“Yeah. Far away from here… but I’m not sure where to look.”</p>
          <p>
            The cashier nods. “I see. In that case, there’s a hotel just across two
            intersections offering free stay-ins for a maximum of five days every month. I
            spoke to the owner of the hotel, and they told me that they longed to
            accommodate people who have no money in their pocket.”
          </p>
          <p>“Really?”</p>
          <p>“Yeah! Also, they offer free food and drinks during those free stay-ins.”</p>
          <p>“I see,” I nod. “I should take a look.”</p>
          <p>
            After the cashier handed me the bottle and the receipt, I thanked and went to
            the hotel between the intersections. There, I met the owner of the hotel who
            was offering free stay-ins for those who cannot afford one.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s like what the cashier said,” I thought.</p>
          <p>
            After exchanging details with the owner, I proceeded to the room I was
            assigned to. Inside, the layout is just enough for me to fit in for a while.
          </p>
          <p>
            Putting the luggage on one side, I head to the bathroom to take a nice, long
            shower.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic;">Later…</p>
          <p>
            “That was relaxing,” I thought as I changed dresses. I have a lot of these,
            though they are pretty much the same.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyhow, I took the previous clothes to the washer, and stayed cozy in bed for
            about two days and six hours. The food was nice, and by the time I checked out
            of the hotel, I became as healthy as I was back then.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pretty good for a hotel that offers free stay-ins for a maximum of five days
            per month.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I made my way to other parts of the town, I somehow bumped into a strange
            lady who appeared taller than me. “I’m sorry,” I apologized.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s okay,” the woman hushes. “It’s not your fault.”</p>
          <p>I giggle. “Okay then. My name is Agatha. Some call me Mother Agatha.”</p>
          <p>“Nice to meet you, Agatha. My name is Aura.”</p>
          <p>“Same to you, Aura.”</p>
          <p>
            From then on, Aura and I had a small chat over our interests. She excels in
            business and management, but also has a soft side on fashion. She also brought
            me some new samples that I can try wearing in front of her, which somehow made
            me feel embarrassed, to say the least.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, I’m happy that I get to wear the clothes that she handed over to me. It
            felt like a long pipe dream finally ended.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            “So, do you live somewhere, if I may ask?” Asks Aura with a curious look on
            her face.
          </p>
          <p>
            I fiddle my fingers. “Actually, yeah. My home was further away from here. But
            the thing is, it’s closest to a park.”
          </p>
          <p>“It’s probably cozy in there.”</p>
          <p>“It was… until that winter hit, though.”</p>
          <p>
            Her expression turns blank with a hint of sadness. “Um… I’m sorry to hear
            that.”
          </p>
          <p>“Don’t be. I’m trying to move on from it by letting it go.”</p>
          <p>“I see. Does that mean your memories, with that, too?”</p>
          <p>“Sort of.”</p>
          <p>
            Somehow, a phone rang in her pocket, causing her to feel uneasy and pick it
            up. “Hello?...”
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic;">Some time later…</p>
          <p>“Sorry, something came up,” she gets back to her seat.</p>
          <p>“Is… something wrong?”</p>
          <p>
            She sighs. “Well, one of the clients showed up at the workplace… or I should
            say, once was. My colleague told me that he’s feeling too uneasy, walking
            around the corridor and such. And worse, my office was at the end of that
            corridor.”
          </p>
          <p>“That’s… tough.”</p>
          <p>“Yeah. She told me not to show up at work for the rest of the week.”</p>
          <p>I nod. “Do you have somewhere to go?”</p>
          <p>
            “I can go back home, but,” she pauses, holding my hands as her lips turn a
            smile. “Meeting you, for some reason it felt like I’m safe in your hands.”
          </p>
          <p>“Oh you’re flattering me.”</p>
          <p>
            “I’m not flattering you,” she pouts. “I kinda felt… very warm for some
            reason.”
          </p>
          <p>“Really?”</p>
          <p>“Yeah.”</p>
          <p>
            Aura and I glance at each other, her heart beating louder than I expected to
            be. “Can I… hug you?”
          </p>
          <p>
            I slowly nod, pulling her into an embrace. “It surely is hard being a
            businesswoman.”
          </p>
          <p>“Yeah, but I feel relaxed already. Thanks, Agatha.”</p>
          <p>“No problem, Aura.”</p>
          <p>
            And so, I accompanied her back to my hotel room. With the owner’s permission,
            I let Aura stay there with me for three days. As I was exceeding my free
            monthly trial, I was ordered to pay the six-hour stay, but Aura wanted to
            instead.
          </p>
          <p>“Don’t worry about the bills. Think of it as a thank-you for your care.”</p>
          <p>“Thanks, Aura. You’re so kind.”</p>
          <p>“I’m glad I could be of help.”</p>
          <p>
            As the sun rose above us, her phone began to vibrate again. It’s her same
            colleague, but for some reason she appears happy.
          </p>
          <p>“Really? Okay, I’ll be there as soon as I can.”</p>
          <p>
            After wondering what was going on, I can safely conclude that she’s safe from
            the… client, I suppose.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Alright, I gotta get back to work. I can’t wait to show you the new samples
            when I get back!”
          </p>
          <p>“Take care… and be safe.”</p>
          <p>Unfortunately…</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic;">A week later…</p>
          <p>
            At the convenience store, I was talking to the cashier when the television
            program was interrupted by a news report. Feeling uneasy, I turn my attention
            to the screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This is KUIC Breaking News. We’re broadcasting live outside an office
            building near Highlands Street where a woman was found dead on the roadside
            just moments ago. A key witness observed a speeding vehicle that had crashed
            into the woman, but sped away after the accident. The police are currently
            investigating the crime scene and are identifying the woman who died from the
            crash.”
          </p>
          <p>“Wha,” I shriek, frightening the cashier. “Aura?!”</p>
          <p>“Wait, you know the lady?”</p>
          <p>“Y- yeah, I met her just a week ago.”</p>
          <p>
            The cashier nods, handing over a plastic full of tissue paper. “You might need
            this. The crime scene is on Highlands Street.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Taking the plastic bag containing some commodities, I thanked the cashier and
            hurriedly ran to the scene. Several spectators come in, along with the police
            officers.
          </p>
          <p>“Excuse me,” I tried to make my way through the crowd.</p>
          <p>
            As I broke through the spectators, a police officer came up to me. “Excuse me,
            miss; this is a crime scene.”
          </p>
          <p>“Please don’t tell me it isn’t her.”</p>
          <p>
            “Hold on,” another officer calmly mediates the situation. Turning to me, he
            asks, “Are you related to this woman?”
          </p>
          <p>“Yeah. My name is Agatha.”</p>
          <p>
            Another officer came up to the two, holding an ID card. “We found the ID of
            the victim.”
          </p>
          <p>
            As the three chatter about, I glance at the body, trying not to show any signs
            of tears. I just saw a dress lying beside her. “That was the…”
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic;">Rewind...</p>
          <p>Two days before the accident. Aura and I met up at the nearby bench.</p>
          <p>
            “Agatha, you’ll be the first to see this,” Aura said as she pulled a tablet
            from her bag. Displayed on the screen is an upcoming dress to be revealed in
            two days’ time.
          </p>
          <p>“That looks impressive!”</p>
          <p>
            She giggles. “Also, you’ll be the first to wear this precious thing when it’s
            finished.”
          </p>
          <p>I twinkle in awe. “Thank you, Aura!”</p>
          <p>
            “No worries! I’ve been meaning to give you something as a token of
            appreciation, so I hope it has helped. Also, it might help in expanding your
            dress collection.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Yeah,” I scratch my head. “It’s been the same dress that I wore all day. Even
            though I have many dresses…”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’ll help you in finding the right dress for the occasion, if that’s your
            thing~”
          </p>
          <p>“Sure!”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>“That dress…”</p>
          <p>
            People from the press began moving forward, focusing on the three officers.
            “We’ve properly identified the victim. Her name was Aura Ostara, 29 years
            old.”
          </p>
          <p>
            As I realize that the intuition I had for the longest time was true, I begin
            to weep as loud as I can. “Aura… how could you do this to me…”
          </p>
          <p>
            People wandering about were saddened as I lay my head over the deceased body,
            tears falling from my eyes. “Aura, how could you…”
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic;">At the hotel…</p>
          <p>
            “I’m sorry for your loss, miss,” the owner expressed his condolences as they
            realized the news. “But, that dress…”
          </p>
          <p>
            “She wanted to give this to me when it’s done, so I’ll have to wear it in her
            honor.”
          </p>
          <p>“I see.”</p>
          <p>
            Looking at the dress, it had adorned itself in shades of green in a sea of
            whites. Several ornaments cover most parts; most on the chest, and some on the
            waist. It has a ‘Lotus petal’ aesthetic to it -- evident on the uppermost part
            of the bodice. Ornaments were present, and were bestowed the same aesthetic as
            the dress itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I should wear these tomorrow,” I thought, looking at the note that came with
            it. The note reads:
          </p>
          <div class="ltrBox">
            <p>≈≈≈</p>
            <div class="noteTxt">
              <p>To my dearest Agatha,</p>
              <p>
                I’m sorry if this was a sudden change of plan, but I’ll be giving this to
                you when the dress finishes as a final will. As you may have noticed, I
                might have my fate sealed with me that might have caused this to happen in
                the first place.
              </p>
              <p>
                I would like to thank you for the full week of friendship so far. But
                despite our shortcomings, I know that someday, we’ll meet again; and that
                we’ll be sharing the same happiness as back then.
              </p>
              <div class="noteClosing">
                <p>
                  Yours truly,
                  <br>
                  Aura Ostara
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>≈≈≈</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Tears ran through my eyes as I read the whole note over and over again.
            Finally, I whisper to myself, “I will wear it even when we meet again, Aura.”
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic;">In a land far, far away…</p>
          <p>
            The Grand Lady -- keeper of the Luna, has been humming about on her seat when
            she sees a glimmer of light along the long corridor.
          </p>
          <p>“Hm.”</p>
          <p>
            She rises from her seat, hands and arms out -- ready to welcome the new
            prospective member. On the other side of the corridor; a fair-skinned lady was
            wandering around, clueless on what’s happening around her.
          </p>
          <p>“Wh… where am I?”</p>
          <p>
            “Welcome,” the Grand Lady approaches slowly on the woman, a smile beaming on
            her face. “You can call me the Grand Lady.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Their eyes met, the woman nervously responding, “H- hello. My name is Aura.
            How did I get here?”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Grand Lady pauses for a second, then breathes deeply. “Your soul has been
            sent here. Do you remember what happened?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I…” Aura slowly mutters for a second. “I only remember a white flash of
            light… and my body hurting.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Sorrow creeps over the Grand Lady’s face. “Aura… you have died a moment ago.
            Someone hit you with a vehicle, and you collapsed immediately.”
          </p>
          <p>“What?”</p>
          <p>“I know it’s hard to believe, but…”</p>
          <p>Tears began falling from Aura’s eyes. “H- how… she…”</p>
          <p>“She’s okay, but she’s grieving for your loss.”</p>
          <p>“Agatha…”</p>
          <p>
            In a moment of silence that follows, the Grand Lady took Aura to the sanctum.
            There, she brought her a glass of water.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            “I’m… I’m sorry about what happened there. It’s just that I was devastated
            that I lost a friend whom I met just a week ago,” Aura emotionally mutters,
            slowly sipping the water.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Don’t worry about it. I’m sure she’ll keep remembering you. Remember that you
            said you and your company made a dress for her?”
          </p>
          <p>“Yeah.”</p>
          <p>
            “That might be one of the many ways to remember your presence. Her wearing the
            dress symbolizes that she’ll still remember you.”
          </p>
          <p>“I… I don’t know.”</p>
          <p>
            As they glance around, she spots a peculiar tree a few meters behind the Grand
            Lady’s throne. Astonished, she calls out, “Grand Lady, what’s with that tree
            over there?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh,” the Grand Lady turns around, guiding her to the tree. “It’s what they
            call the Celestial Tree, giver of life and energy around here. The Spirits
            work day in and out to ensure that this tree keeps on revitalizing.”
          </p>
          <p>“That’s impressive, I would say. Far more than impressive.”</p>
          <p>
            “Thanks, Aura. This tree symbolizes the rebirth of all that was corrupted
            within in the past. The Spirits… and one Bearer… helped me make this all
            worthwhile.”
          </p>
          <p>Aura appeared confused. “The… Bearer?”</p>
          <p>
            “Yes,” the Grand Lady said in a soft tone. “You probably might not have heard
            of them, but I chose them to become the Bearer because they will hold the
            future of this sanctum… this realm that we’re standing at.”
          </p>
          <p>“What?”</p>
          <p>“I know that you’re confused, but let’s leave that for another time.”</p>
          <p>
            “Hold on,” cue Aura’s uncertainty in her tone. “Do you and the Bearer know
            each other?”
          </p>
          <p>The Grand Lady slowly nods. “It would appear so, yes.”</p>
          <p>
            Despite those uncertainties, Aura nodded back, indicating that she somehow
            understood the situation.
          </p>
          <p>“But… how long will I stay here?”</p>
          <p>
            The Grand Lady sighs. “Not for long, though. You will have a mission to
            fulfill.” Slowly walking around the area, she continues, “A mission that will
            bear the fruit of your compassionate nature amidst the odds.”
          </p>
          <p>“What is it?”</p>
          <p>
            Looking at the pond, the Grand Lady descends to pick up a Lotus flower
            floating above it. She slowly hands it to Aura’s direction.
          </p>
          <p>
            “As a rightful owner of this Lotus, your job is to protect those who will seek
            your warmth and care. A goddess whose beauty resembles the tranquility of
            nature.”
          </p>
          <p>Aura glances at the flower. “A… goddess?”</p>
          <p>“Yes.”</p>
          <p>
            Slowly taking the flower from the Grand Lady, Aura’s body began to glow.
            “What… what’s happening?!”
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic;">A little later…</p>
          <p>The nervous Aura glances at the mirror, then turns back. “What… is this?”</p>
          <p>“You have been reborn, Aura. Your spirit now lies with the Lotus.”</p>
          <p>“What does that even mean?”</p>
          <p>
            Smiling, the Grand Lady gives her a crown -- a crown designed to look like a
            Lotus. “Aura, you are the Celestial Nymph Guardian -- keeper of the Lotuses
            and the carer of the needy.”
          </p>
          <p>“A… Celestial Nymph?”</p>
          <p>The Grand Lady nods. “Yes, your journey begins here.”</p>
          <p>“What…”</p>
          <p>
            The overwhelmed Aura took another look at her newfound appearance. She appears
            to have elf-like ears, ornaments on her hair that look like Lotus petals, and
            gold ornaments around her neck and chest. Her dress and sleeves all have the
            Lotus aesthetic, large frills on her skirt with some extensions about below.
            Her stockings were also adhered to the aesthetic, and her shoes were
            pristine-white with aesthetics around it. Some ornaments also contain rare
            crystals of all kinds, completing her goddess look. Ornaments around the
            fingers were also adhered to the aesthetic, gold fittings covering her nails.
          </p>
          <p>“Is this… really me?”</p>
          <p>
            “Yes, you are,” the Grand Lady expresses her sense of relief. “You are
            definitely a goddess in your own right.”
          </p>
          <p>“Um… what should I do with this?”</p>
          <p>
            The Grand Lady holds another Lotus flower in her hand, the flower itself
            transforming to a book. “Aura, your job is to protect your new realm -- the
            Incorporeal Garden.”
          </p>
          <p>“The… Garden…”</p>
          <p>“But the question is: Are you up to the task?”</p>
          <p>“Um…”</p>
          <p>
            Uncertainties ran in Aura’s head to try and justify the responsibilities that
            she’ll be taking. But after a while of thinking, she finally mustered the
            following words:
          </p>
          <p>“For the sake of those within the Garden, I’ll do my best.”</p>
          <p>
            “Good. I shall bestow you the Oracle in which you will be destined to live on
            for years to come… an Oracle that will serve as your guide in protecting what
            needs to be protected.”
          </p>
          <p>
            A light began illuminating around the tree, the moon above them shining like
            the sun in the night. “As the Grand Lady, your prayers are answered by the
            heavens. Come forth, Aura; for your journey is about to begin.”
          </p>
          <p>Aura steps forward, hands in the air.</p>
          <p>
            “My name… is Aura Ostara. A Celestial Nymph Guardian of the Incorporeal Garden
            and all that is within.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “May the souls of the weeped be petrified in her presence, and the souls of
            the sorrowful be showered with her loving touch,” the Grand Lady chants as the
            Celestial Tree illuminates even brighter.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            Back in the corridor, a portal is waiting. “Aura, your journey starts here.
            But you still have another mission to do.”
          </p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>
            The Grand Lady hands over a leaf to her. “One who represents the Leaf. She
            will come to you and grant you her care. When she gets to your Garden, please
            take care of her.”
          </p>
          <p>“The… Leaf?”</p>
          <p>
            The Grand Lady nods. “Now, hush forward and be of presence to everyone…
            Celestial Nymph Guardian of all the Nimbisouls within, Aura Ostara.”
          </p>
          <p>Aura nods, entering the portal. A few seconds later, the portal vanishes.</p>
          <p>
            The Grand Lady sighs deeply upon witnessing Aura’s departure, a smile on her
            face. “Our Bearer… you will meet her again soon.”
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            Back at the hotel, I just got out of the room as I tried to wear the dress
            Aura gave me. “This looks frilly.”
          </p>
          <p>But it’s beautiful, inside and out; the greens highlighting my presence.</p>
          <p>
            “You look splendid,” the owner glances about, complimenting my appearance. I
            nod in embarrassment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the hotel staff were astonished at how beautiful I was. “Oh come on,
            you’re flattering me,” I shied away.
          </p>
          <p>
            As everyone around the hotel gathers around, some offer their condolences in
            Aura’s wake. I turn to the podium just on the left of the coffin as I give my
            short speech.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the wake ended, so began the funeral. There’s a cemetery just a few walks
            away from here, but everyone was weeping at the loss of a friend’s friend.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic;">Later…</p>
          <p>
            I head back to the room, still wearing the outfit. Just as I was about to
            close my eyes, I felt a sudden rush of air coming from within. “I’m cold,” I
            murmur as I try to sleep.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, from around the room, it started to get warm… or I should say, it was
            once a room. A chant can be heard from a couple of meters away:
          </p>
          <p>“Agatha, your journey continues in the realm of the Incorporeal Garden.”</p>
