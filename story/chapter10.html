        <h2>Chapter 10: Favor</h2>
        <div class="storyText">
          <p>
            “I’m… asking for a favor,” she slowly said. “I don’t know if you’re suitable
            for this, but you can at least try your best.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’ll do what I can,” I reply to her. “But… what was the favor all about?”
          </p>
          <p>
            After a long moment of silence, Hina firmly holds my hand and begins to speak
            in a serious tone.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah… Agatha, can you… work for me?”</p>
          <p>“Eh?”</p>
          <p>
            She gazes at me with a serious look on her face. “I mean it. The first time I
            looked at you, I felt a bit of tranquility and safety; and I can sense that
            working with you will be the best choice I ever made.”
          </p>
          <p>I glance at her with a puzzled look on my face.</p>
          <p>
            “Please,” she begged. “This is my only way to thank you for what you did back
            there. And I need someone who can accommodate me through the Coronation and
            beyond.”
          </p>
          <p>“I…”</p>
          <p>
            My head begins to spin. Was this even a real thing? Or was it one of her
            secret tricks or some sort that I can’t comprehend?
          </p>
          <p>
            But whatever that is, her face appears serious; so I’m fairly certain this has
            something to do with what she’s dealing with.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I don’t know if I can do this right. I mean, it’s an honor to be working
            alongside you, but…”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I can train you on the way,” she suggested. “This way, you’ll be able to
            learn new stuff and accommodate the rest at the same time. I’m always here to
            help you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the things she said made me think deeply about the opportunities. I
            might be able to learn from all the expertise that I’ll be taking with me
            along the way. But, the thing is, I’m not sure how long I will last from this…
          </p>
          <p>
            With a little confidence boost from her, I replied with dignity: “Okay, let’s
            do this.”
          </p>
          <p>“Good!”</p>
          <p>“Um,” I hesitantly back away. “The envelope.”</p>
          <p>
            Hina smiles. “Don’t worry, I already acknowledged it from the beginning. In
            fact, it was I who was supposed to deliver the envelope to you.”
          </p>
          <p>“Oh.”</p>
          <p>
            Despite all the seriousness her face has made, she can be silly at times.
            Although that made me wonder how I would even get to understand her in other
            cases. Must’ve been my imagination.
