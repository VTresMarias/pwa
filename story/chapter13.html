        <h2>Chapter 13: Nickname</h2>
        <div class="storyText">
          <p>
            After the Coronation, I was asked by the Royal Advisor to meet Queen Hina --
            the Oujo-sama -- at the garden. “She wants to tell you something important,”
            he said.
          </p>
          <p>
            I nodded, started getting dressed up, and went down to meet her as instructed.
            From there, Hina was tending to the pots as usual. “How was the coronation?” I
            asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It was fun,” she said. “I’m actually glad that you were there to watch my
            reign. Looks like everything was worth it in the end.”
          </p>
          <p>“Yeah,” I nervously chuckle. “Anyway, why did you bring me here?”</p>
          <p>“Well, um…”</p>
          <p>
            Hina then turns her back, picking something up from the perch. “Agatha, I
            might’ve known you for a few days, but every time I look at you… I feel like I
            need to protect somebody. Somebody who’s willing to put themselves on the line
            for the sake of someone.”
          </p>
          <p>“Hm?”</p>
          <p>She turns back to my direction. “Agatha… or, should I just call you…”</p>
          <p>
            Sighing, she slowly blurts out what would appear to be the nickname that she
            made just for me.
          </p>
          <p>“Aga-chuu?”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>“Um?” I tilt my head.</p>
          <p>
            She smiles. “I know your brain’s a bit fuzzy, but I just want to tell you that
            I’ve been meaning to give you something special as a thanks for always having
            my back. It’s been at the back of my head since I’m trying to make up
            nicknames for my subjects, so I figured I should give you something in that
            regard too.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Aga-chuu…” I begin to memorize the nickname she gave to me many times in my
            head. “That’s… a cute nickname.”
          </p>
          <p>“I know, right?”</p>
          <p>
            We both giggle afterwards. Hearing the nickname over and over again felt like
            I already had a special place in her heart. The maids were right -- she’s
            pretty easy once I get used to working with her.
          </p>
          <p>“So, Aga-chuu,” she said, carrying an item. “Will you accept this?”</p>
          <p>“What?”</p>
          <p>The item she showed me is a pair of wrist beads. “I made these myself.”</p>
          <p>
            Looking at the wrist beads she showed me, there’s a slight tint of pink on
            otherwise pure-green beads. Even so, there&#39;s a number of glitters all over
            the beads; and the bands holding them in place are comfortable enough to wear
            on the wrist for long hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            “These are nice,” I said, taking one of the wrist beads from her hands.
            Wearing it, the beads emit a soft glow of gradient green and pink that
            encircles around my wrist.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hina then slowly inserts the wrist bead into her wrist, also reacting the same
            way as mine. Some few moments later, she begins to shriek. “Uwaah!”
          </p>
          <p>“Um, are you okay?”</p>
          <p>
            “I’m fine,” she said, shaking her wrist. “That shook me for a second… I feel
            like I saw a sudden flashback or something.”
          </p>
          <p>“What did you see?”</p>
          <p>“It’s…”</p>
