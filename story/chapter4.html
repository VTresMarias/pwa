        <h2>Chapter 4: Lotus</h2>
        <div class="storyText">
          <p style="font-style: italic">Several hours later…</p>
          <p>
            Groaning, I try to open my blurry eyes; only to find out that I’m not laying
            on the bed but on the sheets of grass.
          </p>
          <p>
            A soft, blistering wind can be felt from a meter away. As I slowly turn my
            waist, I glance at the shade of the tree below me.
          </p>
          <p>“How long have I been asleep?”</p>
          <p>
            Feeling sloppy, I somehow felt a note lingering on my skirt. I slowly open,
            revealing the following words:
          </p>
          <div class="ltrBox">
            <p>≈≈≈</p>
            <div class="noteTxt">
              <p>
                Find the Lotus, and befriend it -- for your fate awaits at the end of the
                path.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>≈≈≈</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Albeit confused, I tried to read the note slowly. That’s when I realized a
            little pin was attached to the bodice of the dress I’m currently wearing.
            Looking at the pin, it was an etch of the Lotus flower; adorned in colors of
            green and pink.
          </p>
          <p>Slowly, I realize.</p>
          <p>“Grand Lady…”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            At the Incorporeal Garden, there lives a goddess whose loving care and wit
            captured the attention of those who come to it. The beauty that was bestowed
            upon her was unlike any other.
          </p>
          <p>
            She begins to hum, which caught the attention of the critters around the area.
            Butterflies began swirling with the bees, and the caterpillars began camping
            at the leaves on the trees.
          </p>
          <p>
            “What a wonderful song, I’m so glad I sang it for everyone,” she chants in a
            mellow tune. “Don’t worry, little ones; your Celestial Nymph Guardian will
            protect you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s right -- she is the Celestial Nymph Guardian. Legends say that her name
            can’t be spoken unless one has the closest connection with her… which is
            unlikely to happen in the near future.
          </p>
          <p>The Guardian sighs sorrowfully, “If only one can speak my name…”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            Upon learning from the Grand Lady that fate was nearby, I began searching for
            a place that matches that criterion. In that sense, she told me that I would
            be able to rekindle with someone who was lost to a tragedy from back then.
          </p>
          <p>
            But with all the lingering pain in my heart, can I make it through this task?
          </p>
          <p>
            Days and weeks go by. I traveled far and wide in this realm, but with no clue
            nor help. I stopped at a gate, with an arch that says ‘Incorporeal Garden’,
            though.
          </p>
          <p>“How did that get here?”</p>
          <p>
            Feeling uneasy, I made my way inside. Somewhere, there is a house that was
            built to accompany more than ten people. But from the looks of it, the house
            doesn’t appear to be used. There’s a pamphlet, though, giving me access to the
            information about the house.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s called the Fun House,” I mutter as I begin reading all the pages. “I
            wonder what the Fun House is all about.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Unbeknownst to me, a tall figure was standing at the end of the corridor,
            silently gazing at my direction. I immediately glance, only to find out that
            there’s nothing in all areas… at least most of the parts I can see from my
            sitting position.
          </p>
          <p>
            After reading the pamphlet, I then walked over the end of the corridor, only
            to find the vastness of flora and critters on the other end -- the Incorporeal
            Garden in its entirety.
          </p>
          <p>
            The blooming flowers cover the paddings on one side, with the grasses on the
            other. A pathway leads to the pond, where countless amounts of Lotus flowers
            appear to be swirling about. There’s another pond to my right, having the same
            description as the former.
          </p>
          <p>
            I slowly step into the Garden, looking at the pond to my right. A large Lotus
            flower appears, which causes me to pick it up. Looking at it, it reveals a
            certain aura that -- according to the pamphlet -- is rare and has to be
            decoded by ‘someone special to the goddess’.
          </p>
          <p>“Intriguing… I haven’t had any of these before.”</p>
          <p>
            On the other side of the Garden, the Celestial Nymph Guardian has been busy
            tending happily to the critters that come and go. Watching them from where I’m
            sitting, I thought, “They sure are happy that their maiden is around.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Guardian started humming a song, a lullaby… that has put them to their
            slumber in a matter of seconds. “I feel like I heard this before. But I can’t
            remember what.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Then she began singing. A soothing voice, filling the Garden and beyond’s
            reach. To my surprise, I shriek, “Aura… !”
          </p>
          <p>
            Immediately realizing the mistake, I hastily cover my mouth as the Guardian
            stops, looking around for any signs of disturbance. She turns back, gazing at
            the other pond.
          </p>
          <p>
            “For some reason, I was forced to believe someone is here,” she murmurs as she
            heads towards the pond. The big Lotus has been kept there despite everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the Guardian -- Aura -- seemed convinced about something. “Someone special
            to me has the ability to decode what’s the meaning behind this one. And with
            this…”
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>“... I know that she’s here.”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            In a room filled with tables and chairs, I reach for a glass of water. Turning
            my gaze to another pamphlet just beside me, I begin to read its contents. The
            Guardian had just stepped in, offering a bowl of ice cream to the table.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Thanks for the meal,” I said as I began eating, not realizing that she was
            sitting in front of me. When I realized, I properly greeted her.
          </p>
          <p>
            “My apologies for coming here without any invitation. My name is Agatha --
            Mother Agatha.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Guardian hushes, “Don’t worry about it. Call me the Celestial Nymph
            Guardian.”
          </p>
          <p>After eating two spoons of ice cream, I continued, “What a nice name.”</p>
          <p>
            “Thanks. It’s been a while since I’ve had visitors coming from different
            dimensions.”
          </p>
          <p>“That must be tough.”</p>
          <p>“Yeah.”</p>
          <p>
            After conversing for a while, I got a little sleepy. “Um, may I beg your
            pardon; is there any lodging in here?”
          </p>
          <p>“Oh yes, we do. I assume you need one right away?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, please.”</p>
          <p>She nods. “Well then, right this way.”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            After a quick rest by the sofa, I decided to change clothes -- only to find
            out that my dresses were hanging inside the wardrobe. The last time I checked,
            I didn&#39;t have anything with me when I got here.
          </p>
          <p>“How did they get here?”</p>
          <p>
            Then I remember what the Grand Lady said regarding meeting with ‘her’. “But
            why did she go out of her way to deliver the goods here?” I thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, I changed into one of my dresses after taking a warm shower; and
            headed to bed. I remembered the note Aura gave me that at the end said that
            ‘she and I will meet again’... what could she be implying?
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">That evening…</p>
          <p>
            A gentle cold breeze fills the air as I sleep soundly on a cozy bed, not
            noticing the door slowly creaking open. Footsteps slowly run from the door,
            then stop at the side of the bed. Series of nervous breathing can be softly
            heard across.
          </p>
          <p>“W- what should I do…”</p>
          <p>
            The girl softly trembles as she reaches to the foam, a flick of her hand
            slowly creaking the door closed. Slowly climbing up, a gentle touch begins
            swirling around my waist as her arm reaches for my chest -- softly pulling me
            into an embrace.
          </p>
          <p>
            All the while, a whisper can be heard behind me: “Agatha… I’m sorry I had to
            do this, but I missed you so much. If only you were here with me right now… we
            would be sharing the same laughs as what we did in the previous life.”
          </p>
          <p>“Aura… ?!” I thought loudly, trying my best to sleep.</p>
          <p>A sorrowful cry can be heard behind me. “What is she doing back there?”</p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, her sorrows dissipate after a few minutes, as I try to turn
            around to look at her face. Indeed, it was the Celestial Nymph Guardian that
            was with me the whole time!
          </p>
          <p>
            Trying to ease my trembles, I breathe deeply, trying my best to sleep as
            soundly as I can be.
          </p>
          <p>“Zzz…”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic;">The following morning…</p>
          <p>
            The Guardian tries to get up, but realizes that she is in the wrong room.
            Before her eyes is a pristine purple hair, slender figure, and a fair skin
            tone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon realizing, she shrieks silently; then tries to get out of bed as quiet as
            she can.
          </p>
          <p>“No, no no no no no…”</p>
          <p>
            In an attempt to cover up her embarrassment, she quickly laid the blanket, and
            hurriedly left the room.
          </p>
          <p>
            Somehow, the warmth of the blanket slowly woke me up. “Uhm… what happened last
            night?”
          </p>
          <p>
            I don’t seem to quite remember what has happened, but all I know is that I
            slept peacefully during the so-called ‘ordeal’.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carefully making the bed, I then head straight to the dining area; where for
            some peculiar reason a hearty breakfast was served on the table. Behind the
            counter, the Guardian hums as she cycles through the recipe book. Something
            feels… odd, however.
          </p>
          <p>“Um, ma’am?”</p>
          <p>“D- don’t worry about it! Just eat whatever you like.”</p>
          <p>
            As I observe with a worrisome look on my face, another food has been served on
            the table. “Come on, please eat what you like.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Um,” I interrupt. “Isn’t this a bit too much? And I don’t see others around
            that will eat this much food.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Realizing her mistake, the Guardian pulls a chair and sits down. “Then, um… we
            should eat it together, I guess.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I slowly nod, still confused about what has happened today and last night.
            Although my head feels groggy as I just got up moments ago, I ate along with
            her as she declared.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Many people have come and gone,” she said, telling me a story. “Initially,
            this was a sanctuary built upon to cross paths between life and death. I tried
            many things to liven up and give them a place to hang out, but they all
            failed. It’s just…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Somehow I understood most parts of her story as she broke down in tears.
            Feeling worried, I reach out to pat her head.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ma’am… it’s impressive how hard you tried to make this place a suitable one
            to live in. And to be honest, I could do that as well… if I tried.”
          </p>
          <p>“I,” she said as I wiped her tears. “I guess we’re just the same.”</p>
          <p>“I think so.”</p>
          <p>
            We continue eating the meals… just both of us, alone in the dining room. Which
            definitely reminds me of something completely coincidental:
          </p>
          <p>
            Aura and I have been like this since we met for the first time somewhere along
            a peculiar town. We share the same interests, hobbies, and food. And all the
            while, Aura taught me new things in the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This feels… kinda sentimental,” I thought as I finished my plate. “Or was it
            a coincidence?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking at her, she does appear to look like Aura. But how on Earth would I
            tell her about it?
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic;">Some time passed…</p>
          <p>
            In a moment, the Celestial Nymph Guardian took me to the Incorporeal Garden,
            where the critters were waiting. “Agatha, won’t you mind if I tell a story to
            these about something sentimental for me?”
          </p>
          <p>I shook my head. “I don’t mind. I’m sure that memory is lively.”</p>
          <p>“Yeah.”</p>
          <p>
            As the critters make their noises, the Guardian begins telling the story. The
            story of…
          </p>
          <p>
            “Me?” I shriek silently, trying not to obstruct her storytelling session. “B-
            but how would she remember what happened? Was it…”
          </p>
          <p>
            As the Guardian continued with her story, something clicked in our heads.
            Something that opened our eyes about what has just happened from the get-go.
          </p>
          <p>Slowly, her gaze met mine. “Um,” she murmurs, possibly talking to me.</p>
          <p>“Y- yes?”</p>
          <p>The Guardian readies herself. “You are… Agatha, right?”</p>
          <p>“Yes,” I slowly nod.</p>
          <p>
            In a spur of a moment, tears begin to fall from her eyes as she immediately
            pulls me into her embrace. Her voice begins to crack as she begins crying out
            loud.
          </p>
          <p>“Agatha!!!”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            From afar, the Grand Lady observes the Celestial Nymph Guardian breaking down
            in tears, a smile forming on her face.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It would appear that the customer from yesterday was your long lost friend,
            after all. Agatha, your journey continues. Keep it up.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Walking away from the scene, a portal opens before her; stepping inside into
            yet another territory adorned with royalties on all sides.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic;">A while later…</p>
          <p>
            I got out of my room, with the dress that I remember was the one she gave to
            me in her wake during her previous life. The Celestial Nymph Guardian -- no,
            Aura -- stood in shock and awe.
          </p>
          <p>“You look… beautiful!”</p>
          <p>
            I beamed at her, gazing at her current outfit as I shy away. “Yours look
            splendid, too.”
          </p>
          <p>“Oh come on, no need to flatter me. You’re way more beautiful than I am.”</p>
          <p>
            Embarrassing at each other, we spent the next few days talking about things
            that we’re supposed to discuss during her previous life. How life has been for
            me, and how worried sick I am to realize what her fate was.
          </p>
          <p>It’s as if she’s my own sister that I can turn to in times of trouble.</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic;">The following days pass…</p>
          <p>
            Aura and I sat on the edge of the pond that she used to go to, with her
            looking at the Lotuses that have come and gone.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The Lotuses were very beautiful this time of the day,” she said with a smile
            on her face. “I could look at them all day and wonder what it’s like being
            with you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I blush at her comment. I reply, “You’re just exaggerating. I’m not that much
            as you are.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh don’t be so humble,” she pats my head. “It’s just that… I finally get to
            spend this day and everyday with you. Do you realize how desperate I am to go
            back to that life I had just to stay close to you?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “You… thought of me that much?” I shriek in shock. “I didn’t realize that.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Now you do,” she said, holding a large Lotus into my direction. “This here
            has the colors of purple and green. The same colors of our hair.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I looked at the Lotus she brought. “They look splendid. It’s like the one I
            saw on the other pond.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “They’re the same,” she smiles. “These kinds of Lotuses have this special
            ability to change colors whenever something significant happens inside the Fun
            House.”
          </p>
          <p>“Whoa.”</p>
          <p>
            We both laugh gracefully, telling each other stories about various things;
            leading up to what has happened during her wake, and how I wore the dress.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s beautiful to see that you’ve come here to see me, and that I’m glad that
            I can stay beside you again,” she calmly sighs. “But the question is, who
            brought you here?”
          </p>
          <p>“Uh…”</p>
          <p>Remembering what the Grand Lady told me, I begin to tell her a story.</p>
          <p>“Do you know the Grand Lady?” I ask.</p>
          <p>“... somewhat.”</p>
          <p>
            I sigh deeply. “Look, I know I told you my side of the story back then, but
            that was just brief. What really happened was more than what I could bear when
            I realized it the first time.”
          </p>
          <p>“Please tell me about it.”</p>
          <p>“Okay, here goes.”</p>
          <p>
            I take another deep sigh, before blurting out my mouth, telling the whole
            story.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I first met the Grand Lady when I was reanimated back to life. She has this
            long, blonde hair that stretches all the way to her thighs. Her dress was very
            simple but elegant, adorning a white rose tiara on her head. She also has
            these ‘angelic’ wings on the back. She told me to leave this place soon, but
            all the memorable bearings will remain in her sanctuary of sorts. One that has
            a… tree in the middle.”
          </p>
          <p>Realizing that Aura encountered a similar angel, she gasps.</p>
          <p>“Aura?”</p>
          <p>
            “Um,” she stammers for a bit. “I feel like I’ve seen an angel of that
            characteristic before.”
          </p>
          <p>“Did she tell you what her name is?”</p>
          <p>“... Grand Lady.”</p>
          <p>
            Realizing that, I firmly held her hand. “Maybe we were called here for a
            reason.”
          </p>
          <p>“What?”</p>
          <p>
            “I mean, I don’t know what her true intentions were, but she told me to find
            someone who will cherish me the same way I do to them. That’s what got me into
            this.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Aura smiles. “But, you did say that she resurrected you, right? So, what
            happened in your previous life?”
          </p>
          <p>I breathe deeply for a moment, then continue the story.</p>
          <p>
            “In my previous life, I had a husband and four kids. He was a hunter, and I
            was taking care of our offspring our entire life. We enjoyed every moment,
            until… he was not with us several months before this terrifying mixture of
            winter and hunger hit our lovely home. I was forced to let the kids hunt for
            food, in which there was no success; and we let the days pass with an empty
            stomach.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Wait, what?!” Aura shrieks. “Did you just
            <span style="font-style: italic">force</span> your kids to hunt?”
          </p>
          <p>
            I stammer. “I- I didn&#39;t have a choice back then! And someone has to man
            the house while Darling is out!”
          </p>
          <p>
            After calming down, I continued: “Well, we spent every day with no food on our
            plate. So, I basically had no choice but to make a fine sacrifice.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “So you basically murdered your own children for the sake of food? How
            terrible!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I know, and even now I still can’t gloss over what happened. I’m ashamed, and
            I failed as a mother,” I reply with a saddened look on my face. “And now that
            the youngest son knew what was going on that his brothers were missing, I
            tried to contain the situation. But… I failed, and I asked him for a favor to
            finally leave me behind.”
          </p>
          <p>Tears suddenly broke down on my cheeks.</p>
          <p>“I… I don’t deserve this…”</p>
          <p>
            I yell in agony, letting all of my emotions out in a heartbeat. Aura doesn’t
            seem disappointed, however; she was just saddened by what I just did, but
            given that the Grand Lady tried to make amends because there’s a mission that
            I had to fulfill, she comforts me instead with a lullaby.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic;">That evening…</p>
          <p>
            I slept soundly for the first time in a while. I didn’t realize I was sick
            until I sneezed an hour ago. Aura came into my room, medications in her hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Agatha, please get some rest,” she said, putting a piece of cloth on my
            forehead. “I know there’s still many things that happened in your previous
            life, but just try to make up for it with the new memories we’ll be sharing
            together. Just… always remember that I’m always with you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            She gets off, and sits on the bed beside me. “We might have the same
            circumstances. But if we can work things out together, we can overcome them.”
          </p>
          <p>
            She continues comforting me for another few days; and as I got healthier, so
            is my desire to eat more food.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic;">A week later…</p>
          <p>Aura and I are in a secret labyrinth. “Just what is this place?”</p>
          <p>She spins around, a smile on her face. “This is my secret make-up room.”</p>
          <p>“Um, a make-up room?”</p>
          <p>“Yup, full of cosmetics and stuff!”</p>
          <p>
            She took me around her secret room, full to the brim with cosmetic make-ups
            and hair coloring agents. It seems she had been studying fashion long enough
            to be inherited in her new life, I guess.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The main reason I brought you here is that if you need some sort of a
            make-over, I can help you out. I don’t study fashion for nothing!” She
            giggles.
          </p>
          <p>
            I glance in awe at how gorgeous the place is. It has every bit of fashion
            make-over in full detail, and somehow it doesn’t feel too compromising.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Truth be told,” I mutter. “I definitely need a new make-over to start over
            with a new life I was brought into, I guess.”
          </p>
          <p>Aura, happy at that idea, firmly holds my hand. “Then it’s settled!”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            At the cabinet sit some various hair coloring solutions. “Go take your pick!
            No need to rush,” she said.
          </p>
          <p>
            I nod, looking at the coloring agents displayed. They all look tempting, to
            say the least.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hm… there’s a lot of tempting colors, I don’t know which one suits me best.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Aura steps in, a pat on my shoulder. “My best advice I can give you is that
            you’ll need to choose a color that is memorable… a color that will make you
            feel new and refreshing. And in addition, it has to be something that you’ll
            be associating with for years to come.”
          </p>
          <p>“For years to come,” I thought.</p>
          <p>
            The color that I’ll be choosing should be something that has a great impact,
            and shows what you will be to the public. Something that will make you unique,
            and something that will become the ‘trademark’ of your presence.
          </p>
          <p>A few minutes later, I finally made my decision.</p>
