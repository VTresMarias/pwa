        <div class="storyText">
          <p>
            “Have you decided on what color to choose, Agatha?” She asked. What she saw in
            my hand is a color that has a distinction similar to hers.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s this one that brought me back to you again,” I smile. “So, I wanted this
            as a new beginning.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Aura nods in agreement. “The case has been settled, then. Do you need anything
            else, like, changing of clothes or whatever?”
          </p>
          <p>
            I begin to think about it. I like the dress that she gave to me, but I’m still
            quite fond of the dress I usually wore, so…
          </p>
          <p>“Cosmetics will also apply, but the clothing doesn&#39;t.”</p>
          <p>
            “You mean, you’re still going to wear the dresses that you have in the
            wardrobe?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I mean, there has to be a specialty in these dresses that I usually wear,
            so…”
          </p>
          <p>She nods. “Okay, if that’s how it will be done.”</p>
          <p>
            Taking the box away from my hand, she instructs, “Please head over to the room
            just over there. I’ll be with you in a bit.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I nod, heading to the room as instructed; feeling a little uncertainty about
            what will happen afterwards.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            “I’m coming in,” she said, some materials in her hand. “Are the preparations
            ready on your end?”
          </p>
          <p>I nod.</p>
          <p>
            “Then… without further ado, let’s begin. Close your eyes, and feel the energy
            from within.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I then closed my eyes as I was instructed to, letting her feel my hair. The
            pristine, purple hair that I always had for many years will be given a new
            color to celebrate a new milestone in life. The uncertainties that were
            supposed to hinder my thoughts were beginning to weaken as I was being
            enveloped by her presence.
          </p>
          <p>
            All the moment, I can hear her chanting a verse. “I feel like I heard it
            before,” I thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a few minutes, Aura begins brushing my hair with her own hands. I wonder
            what she’s planning to do…
          </p>
          <p>
            “The rebirth is just beginning, Agatha. A new path will open, giving you
            another chapter to write your own history to.”
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>“Now, turn around,” she instructed, cosmetics in her hand.</p>
          <p>
            I glance in awe as she leans forward, the eyeliners doing their jobs in
            coloring my eyebrows and eyelashes. She then puts on an extra piece of
            eyelashes to distinguish my new look. But I noticed that she dips them in some
            sort of a liquid solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I would recommend that you don’t take a bath for at least a week to allow
            them to permanently attach to your skin and grow naturally,” she advises. “If
            you need a bath, just tell me.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Um what?” I ask in a confused state. “So you mean, that liquid you dipped the
            eyelashes…”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh, this?” She shows the container to my direction. “It’s a special formula
            that allows these eyelashes to ‘naturally’ bond with the human skin, but they
            need to be left untouched for at least a week once put on the skin for maximum
            effects.”
          </p>
          <p>“That’s… pretty interesting.”</p>
          <p>
            After she’s done with the eyelashes, she picks up lipstick from her tray.
            “Stay put, this’ll take a while.”
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">A few moments later…</p>
          <p>
            “And it’s done,” Aura declares, fixing my hair. “Let’s get you to a mirror so
            that you can grace upon your new beauty.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I got off from my chair and faced the mirror. There, I can see the new version
            of myself in complete awe. Not only did she manage to color my hair nicely,
            she also modified the colors of my eyes, too?
          </p>
          <p>
            “There’s still some changes that need to be implemented, but we can do that in
            your room.”
          </p>
          <p>I couldn’t speak, my emotions were in complete awe. “Wow…”</p>
          <p>“I hope you like the new look! It’s just as you requested~”</p>
          <p>“I… I love this! I don’t know why, but this made me feel very happy.”</p>
          <p>
            “I’m glad that you did! I don’t know if it signifies that you and I were
            alike, but this is a step in the right direction for you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I nod. “I have decided on this look because… I need to feel connected to you
            again, being my first ‘true’ friend.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Aura shies away, her cheeks reddening. I can tell she’s embarrassed, so I
            smiled softly.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            From afar, the Grand Lady saw both of us complimenting each other, and sighs
            in relief. “My precious Bearer, you have chosen a path unlike any other that
            I’ve seen in your dreams. A path that will put you forward as someone who one
            has loved so much. May the new path that has opened bear fruit of your
            continuous labor of love and sympathy.”
          </p>
          <p>
            As she walks away, a portal has appeared before her, and on the other side is
            a woman who’s not aware of the events that have happened over there. “Um… Miss
            Grand Lady, what’s going on over there?”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Grand Lady pats her head, saying: “It’s the beginning of a fostered
            relationship that will prove that every compassion and love knows no
            boundaries or walks of life. Keep an eye out for it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The woman was adorned in a black regal dress; with long, black hair that
            extends far over her waist. She wears a gold, unusual crown that might have
            resembled something else at one point.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Grand Lady walks forward to the castle, where the guards are monitoring
            the two. “Gentlemen, someone from the land afar will be visiting us in due
            course. Let the Oujo-sama know about it.”
          </p>
          <p>“At ease.”</p>
          <p>
            As the Grand Lady walks inside the castle, she immediately disappears; causing
            everyone around the vicinity to hearsay about her.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Enough with the rumors,” the woman from earlier -- an Ojou-sama -- steps in.
            She appears to be back from outside the castle. “I understand that most of you
            don’t know her, but she meant no harm to this kingdom. Let’s keep doing what
            we can and not worry about the rest.”
          </p>
          <p>“Understood, Oujo-sama,” the servants said in harmony.</p>
          <p>
            Few moments went by, and the Ojou-sama was in her room, contemplating certain
            things. “I wonder if what the Grand Lady’s Oracle is true,” she thought.
          </p>
          <p>At the same time, she felt a cold breeze from her windows.</p>
          <p>“I think I should get some sleep.”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">Some time later…</p>
          <p>
            The Ojou-sama got up from the bed, but it’s not her bed that she slept on.
            Looking around, this is not supposed to be her own room. From afar, she can
            see the Grand Lady humming something.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Um, Grand Lady?” She asked as she got out of bed, approaching her direction.
          </p>
          <p>The Grand Lady smiles. “Ojou-sama, are you feeling well?”</p>
          <p>“I am.”</p>
          <p>
            “Good,” she nods, picking up a Sakura (Cherry Blossom flower) from the pond.
            “The trees sure have changed, haven’t they?”
          </p>
          <p>She looks up to see the tree. “I think so.”</p>
          <p>“I mean,” mutters the Grand Lady. “Lotus flowers were blooming before.”</p>
          <p>“Eh?”</p>
          <p>
            The Grand Lady hands her a photo frame, where inside lies a dried Lotus.
            “Someone came here before you, and with it, a new symbol to be attained.”
          </p>
          <p>“Wait, what does that even mean… ?”</p>
          <p>
            The Grand Lady then hands over the Sakura flower to her direction. “You are
            the new person to arrive here, so I’ll give you a flower as a token of
            appreciation… and as a symbol of your presence.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite being confused, she hesitantly takes the flower. It began to
            illuminate, engulfing her in an innocuous presence.
          </p>
          <p>“Wow.”</p>
          <p>The Grand Lady smiles, looking at her with pure bliss. “How was it?”</p>
          <p>
            “I feel… odd, for whatever reason. But other than that, I feel rejuvenated.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “That’s great to hear,” the Grand Lady replies. “Um, if you don’t mind… may I
            ask for your name?”
          </p>
          <p>“Okay,” she shies away for a bit. “Um, my name is Hina. Hina Oujo.”</p>
          <p>“So that’s where the nickname ‘Oujo-sama’ comes from.”</p>
          <p>Hina giggles. “Yeah. Took me a while to get used to it, though.”</p>
          <p>
            “Not many people can recognize a royal-like nickname like that, I presume.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Hina and the Grand Lady laugh softly, as their relationships slowly begin to
            deepen. After a while, the Grand Lady gave her some food.
          </p>
          <p>“Here’s some that I’ve prepared. I hope you like them.”</p>
          <p>“Yeah.”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            At the end of the corridor, the portal began to open, leading Hina back to her
            homeland. “I need to go -- I have to return to my royal duties.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “No worries. Call me anytime,” the Grand Lady nods. “And, I assume you already
            got the memo?”
          </p>
          <p>“Yeah. I wonder who that was, though.”</p>
          <p>“You’ll learn soon enough.”</p>
          <p>Hina nods, waving goodbye as she steps to the other side of the portal.</p>
          <p>
            The Grand Lady sighs deeply, contemplating what has happened. “My dearest
            Bearer, the Third Maria is waiting for your call.”
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">A week later…</p>
          <p>
            Back at the Fun House, Aura was having some final touches that will reflect my
            new appearance. “Is this good?” She asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            “More than enough,” I reply, looking at her. She seems to be comfortable
            enough to stick with me at all times, it seems.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Somehow I still need to get used to this new look,” I add, implying the new
            look I was bestowed with a week ago.
          </p>
          <p>Aura reassures. “It’s gonna be fine.”</p>
          <p>“I hope so.”</p>
          <p>
            And with a full week ended, I’m now back to my usual movements. But my mind
            has been filled with lots of questions why this had happened in the first
            place. Why did the so-called ‘Grand Lady’ offer me missions like this, just to
            aim for my achievement of being close to someone? Why was I put in places like
            this? And what good would it give me in the long run…
          </p>
          <p>
            … when all I truly want is to leave it all behind and start fresh as a new
            being. Being able to be revived by a goddess was an experience of a lifetime,
            but…
          </p>
          <p>
            “... is there a problem?” Aura asks, a worried look on her face. “Is it
            something to do with the Grand Lady?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Wait -- how can she read what I’m thinking? That thought made me back off for
            a bit.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Um… I’m sorry, it’s just that you’ve been thinking a lot about what happened
            before we met for the first time, is all.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s not your fault,” I smile. “Although I’m a bit confused as to why I was
            let to deal with circumstances just to be with you.”
          </p>
          <p>“I can understand that.”</p>
          <p>
            “But,” I smile. “The most important thing right now is that I get to be close
            to you more than ever! Isn’t that great?”
          </p>
          <p>“It is!”</p>
          <p>
            Aura and I giggle for a few moments, which in turn lead to telling stories
            about various things, and even sleeping close to each other on a single bed.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">The following morning…</p>
          <p>
            “I hope to be more powerful enough to follow you out of here, but
            responsibilities are calling me unfortunately,” Aura said, saddened by my
            sudden decision to leave.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I know it’ll be hard, but don’t worry about me,” I pat her on the head.
            “Because I’ll always have you.”
          </p>
          <p>Aura blushes, shying away in embarrassment.</p>
          <p>“So, what will you do now? Are you meeting the Grand Lady?”</p>
          <p>
            “Yeah,” I nod. “She wants me to meet with someone from a faraway place, it
            seems.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Immediately, Aura firmly holds my hand. “Hey, I don’t know if you’ve realized
            this, but I dreamed about something different last night.”
          </p>
          <p>“What is it?”</p>
          <p>
            Aura sighs. “It’s that… we’re in a garden; filled with Leaves, Lotuses, and
            Sakuras… and the other woman was there waiting for us to come by.”
          </p>
          <p>“That… woman?”</p>
          <p>“She was dressed regally, waiting for us under the trees.”</p>
          <p>“She must be very nice, I presume.”</p>
          <p>
            “And that’s not all -- we all heard a voice from the heavens, calling us…
            Marias?”
          </p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>We both get confused. Marias?</p>
          <p>
            “What I mean is, I’m now asking you to prove if what the voice said in my
            dream is true. Maybe the Grand Lady can give you the answers that we need. And
            find out who that woman was from under the tree.”
          </p>
          <p>“Okay, if you say so.”</p>
          <p>
            As I bid goodbye to Aura for one last time, a stream of Lotus flowers were
            flowing across the pond, colors in vibrant green and purple.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aura sighs as she watches me leave. “Until we meet again, Agatha dearest.”
