        <h2>Chapter 1: Arisen</h2>
        <div class="storyText">
          <p>
            The next day, the sun was glittering with the greenest of grass swirling about
            above the ground. It’s been years since the last spring where the body of the
            revered Mother was left to rot after an unrefined revelation brought upon by
            the chills of winter. Three of the four children had their fate sealed and
            their flesh nabbed from their body for each other’s food supply.
          </p>
          <p>
            But just yesterday, the Mother who was once dead has arisen from its point of
            death and decay back to life -- all thanks to the work of a deity known as the
            ‘Grand Lady’. With such grace, she has commanded the Mother to find the true
            path that will define her as someone whom everyone loved.
          </p>
          <p>It’s been that day that she realized that she needs to take action.</p>
          <p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">
            Mother Agatha’s story starts here.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            Morning. The sun was glittering outside the dark shade of the windows, the
            leaves fluttering about in the trees far away. The grasses have been swaying
            for hours, flowers of all kinds blooming delightful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Slowly, I get out of bed, and grab myself some water to start the day. Heading
            towards the hallway, I take a look at the portrait of the four kids -- my own
            children -- who have their fate sealed because of my ‘indecisive’ actions. But
            even still, I could not forget the times that we were struggling so much for
            food, that I thought that there was no other choice back then.
          </p>
          <p>
            Letting the tears fall from my eyes, I solemnly and sorrowfully apologized to
            the kinds that I had lost. “I hope you can forgive me,” I softly cried.
          </p>
          <p>
            Several minutes later, I wipe the tears from my eyes, and usher for the main
            door. Slowly, I breathe deeply, and slowly creak the door open.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside, there were no traces of snow. None of them that reminds of the
            endless winter days from years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can still hear the children playing about weeks before that endless winter
            had arrived. The kind that brought laughter and joy to the hearts of those who
            can hear them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, it’s all empty, the greens only isolating the situation away from public
            view.
          </p>
          <p>I sigh, drinking my glass of water.</p>
          <p>“What should I do…”</p>
          <p>
            At that moment, I remember what the woman -- the Grand Lady -- told me about
            some so-called ‘mission’, but I’m not quite sure about finding those who will
            truly care for me. In this state, I might not even consider myself as someone
            who was cared for by others.
          </p>
          <p>“But… how would I do that?”</p>
          <p>
            Feeling the guilt inside me, I kneel down on the ground, the skirt of my dress
            laying low on the grass, and muster the following words: “How would I be able
            to become someone who will care for by others when I committed a horrendous
            act that has costed me my life?”
          </p>
          <p>
            At that time, the clouds begin to dissipate, the morning sun shining even
            brighter than before. A female voice echoes the area.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Don’t be afraid, Agatha. For I have blessed you with an unconditional love
            that goes beyond borders. The guilt that has passed on will be gone as soon as
            you find your content to those who will care for you.”
          </p>
          <p>I gasp. “Huh?”</p>
          <p>“I trust in you, my precious Bearer.”</p>
          <p>
            After what she said, the sun was back to its previous state. “This heat,” I
            thought as I felt the burning sensation seeping within my body.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>“Remember us!”</p>
          <p>
            I immediately turn around as I hear a mysterious voice coming out of nowhere.
            “Who… who are you?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Please try to remember the loving care you bestowed upon us during the times
            we were alive,” another voice resonates around the scenery.
          </p>
          <p>“I… I…”</p>
          <p>
            “Don’t worry, we’re now safe up here,” another smiles at me. “We wish you good
            luck. And when our only brother left we said hi.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The wind starts to blow towards my direction, a cold breeze flailing about
            between the strands of my hair. I inadvertently smile, looking at the blue sky
            with the shimmering warmth of sunlight.
          </p>
          <p>“I won’t forget you. All of you.”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            After gaining much composure, I immediately stood up, glass in hand, as I made
            my way back to the house.
          </p>
          <p>
            I immediately head straight to my room, where inside the drawer is a
            mysterious key. “The key to the workshop,” I thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            I head back outside, and rush to the back of the house. “I hope the lock was
            still in perfect condition.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Turning the key, I head inside, only to find lots of dangerous materials lying
            about on the floor. “Darling used to hunt with some of these back when he was
            with us,” I contemplated as I read the books laying on the table.
          </p>
          <p>
            The books seem to be discussing certain things and how to handle them
            properly. I try to find ones labeled ‘explosives’.
          </p>
          <p>“... a pretty explosive situation, I must say.”</p>
          <p>
            Eager to put these into practice, I set out to gather the materials needed to
            make explosives. “I wonder how I would be able to do this.”
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">Several hours later…</p>
          <p>
            I indulged in some dinner consisting of only apples I picked from the trees
            just this afternoon. I need some sleep, and probably some time to think about
            it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I head back to my room, glancing at the group photo of my kids another time. I
            gently smile, and head inside with tears falling from my eyes.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            The next morning, I was hard at work again. I tried to make various iterations
            of the explosives, but somehow they were not that great. “I thought I had it,”
            I grit my teeth, but I kept on working just to make sure they work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The same cycle goes on and on, until the sixth day… still thinking about the
            children that I had lost, and what mission that will bring to me.
