        <h2>Chapter 14: Overseer</h2>
        <div class="storyText">
          <p style="font-style: italic">Two weeks have passed…</p>
          <p>
            I was around the corridor when I saw some new faces around these parts. They
            seem to be a part of the committee that I’m about to partake in as per Hina’s
            directive.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Pleased to meet you all,” I greeted them one by one. They seem excited to
            work here, as I observed their morale at first glance.
          </p>
          <p>
            I glance over to the left, looking at the guy with a peculiar hairstyle. He
            seems to be bothered by something. I approach, “Is everything okay?”
          </p>
          <p>He nods, but seems to be nervous or something.</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">A while later…</p>
          <p>
            “Good morning everyone,” Hina approaches the pact with pins on a box.
            “Everyone except Aga-chuu, get your pins here.”
          </p>
          <p>“Um?” I tilt my head.</p>
          <p>
            Taking out of her pocket, she personally hands over a pin to my direction.
            “Here you go.”
          </p>
          <p>
            By appearance, it’s shaped like a Chrysanthemum. The material that was used to
            make the pin was made from a delicate mixture of alloy and rare metallic
            minerals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their pins also feature the same material as mine, but were shaped like a
            Hibiscus.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I hope you like it,” she said, grinning as she turned to face the others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clapping her hands, everyone gathered in a specific spot. “Everyone, I would
            like to thank you all for coming here today,” she began her speech. “As you
            may have noticed, I have been growing restless lately, so I definitely need
            some help from across the board. Along with it, the Royal Advisor told me that
            I need to get hours of rest so that I can’t be all stressed out every time.”
          </p>
          <p>
            She also adds, “So, with that, I would like to congratulate you all for
            becoming my Royal Subjects. Tomorrow, you’ll begin your duty as such, aiding
            anyone&#39;s help when necessary. And of course, your job is to protect the
            kingdom at all costs.”
          </p>
          <p>“We’ll do our best, Oujo-sama,” they all said.</p>
          <p>
            “Very well,” she nods. “If you need some advice or any aid, Aga-chuu will be
            here to serve you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I bow before them following her signal. “At ease. My name is Mother Agatha,
            but you can just call me Aga-chuu. I’ll be here to help you with anything, as
            long as it’s necessary. And also, you can ask me for advice, or basically
            anything on your mind.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Also,” she raises her index finger. “She’s our Grand Overseer, so please be
            good to her, okay?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone nods, bowing at me afterwards. I feel weirded out, but if this is
            something that was common between Royals, then I can live with that.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Now Aga-chuu, I’ll need you to follow me to my room after this,” she
            whispered to my ear. “I need your help with something important.”
          </p>
          <p>“Sure, anything you need.”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">A while later…</p>
          <p>
            Hina and I are back in her room, with her carrying the dress that I wore on
            the Coronation. “I just had this little assumption about the sudden glow from
            our dresses back at the Chapel that somehow internally freaked me out.”
          </p>
          <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
          <p>
            “What I mean is,” she continues, caressing the dress. “There has been some
            kind of an ‘aura’ that made it that way. If someone notable wears it in a
            specific event, then both dresses will glow.”
          </p>
          <p>“And that includes your Coronation dress, right?”</p>
          <p>“Yeah.”</p>
          <p>
            As we ponder on the origins of the so-called ‘aura’, she gets out of bed to
            show me the box -- containing three pins, three bracelets of varying colors,
            and a photo frame.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Can you determine why the Grand Lady decided to give me this box?” Hina
            asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            I then inspect the items carefully. Given how unique the design of these
            bracelets were, and how the pins closely resemble the three plants, I tried to
            make an assumption. But something clicked in my head while I contemplated the
            assumptions.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You know, I actually dreamed about something that might’ve been related to
            the box,” I said. “The Grand Lady told me that the box you have at the moment
            is only one out of three boxes that only the Marias can locate and acquire.
            Those boxes contain three valuable items, each with quantities to a maximum of
            three, and are located in various notable locations within the Marias’
            vicinity.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “But the problem is, why do they call the people Marias? So, I’m assuming I’m
            one of them?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “That could be a point, but we don’t have enough proof just yet. Also, the
            items on these boxes can’t be used until a specific time, where all three
            Marias come together to reminisce and bond together for the future. Now that I
            mentioned it, it somehow sounds like the Oracle that I had before meeting
            Aura.”
          </p>
          <p>“An Oracle?” Hina tilts her head. “And who is Aura?”</p>
          <p>
            “To answer your questions: The Oracle that was bestowed upon me is that I must
            ‘find people who will care for me regardless of my past circumstances’; and
            Aura… she’s currently the Celestial Nymph Guardian whom I met some time ago.”
          </p>
          <p>“That reminds me, I kinda heard about her before,” Hina nods.</p>
          <p>
            “But even still,” I add. “That might not add to the fact that there’s still
            some mysteries left to be solved in the long run.”
          </p>
          <p>“Then we need to get to it.”</p>
          <p>
            Putting the items in the box, we get out of bed as we prepare for the
            underlying responsibilities ahead.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            The following days turned to weeks as I continued my obligations as a Royal
            Accomplice. Having to serve and protect the Queen and her people has become my
            daily habit, to the point that I’ve gotten better thanks to the tasks she
            threw at me.
          </p>
          <p>Everything seemed chill, until…</p>
