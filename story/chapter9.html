        <h2>Chapter 9: Memories</h2>
        <div class="storyText">
          <p style="font-style: italic">A day later…</p>
          <p>
            I made my way towards the place where Hina and I were supposed to meet -- one
            of her gardens. “Where could she be?” I thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            From afar, I can see Hina panting as she runs in my direction. “Sorry I’m
            late,” she said.
          </p>
          <p>
            “There’s nothing to apologize for,” I hushed it off. “Rather, why did you take
            me to this place?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Regaining her breath, she calmly walks down towards a row full of young
            plants. “Here,” she said, handing me a planter. “This is one of the saplings
            of the Cherry Blossom. Someone gave a whole bag of seeds and this one to me
            some time ago.”
          </p>
          <p>“That looks beautiful,” I gleam at the sapling. “Where are the others?”</p>
          <p>
            “They’re right over there,” she glances at the bench in response, where a
            number of planters and their saplings of a similar kind were placed.
          </p>
          <p>“Wow.”</p>
          <p>
            Carefully placing the planter back to its original spot, Hina slowly holds my
            hand. “You know, I wanted to ask you a little question so I decided that we
            meet up here.”
          </p>
          <p>“Why? You could ask me some in your room, though.”</p>
          <p>
            “It’s tranquil here,” she said with a slow nod. “I like the atmosphere of this
            place, it makes me wanna read a book without dealing with the outside noise.
            And the planters that we saw had a significance to it.”
          </p>
          <p>I nod. “Okay, what was it?”</p>
          <p>
            “So… yesterday, I found a box on top of one of the drawers. They contain three
            bracelets, a photo frame, and three pins of varying symbols.”
          </p>
          <p>“A… box?”</p>
          <p>
            “It’s not just an ordinary box, as far as I can tell,” she shakes her head.
            “So I had to ask the Grand Lady about it. She told me that all will be in
            place when the so-called ‘First Maria’ will then be able to rekindle my heart
            once more.”
          </p>
          <p>“Sounds like a dream, if you ask me.”</p>
          <p>“But the question is… who’s the First Maria?”</p>
          <p>
            I shrug. “I have no idea. Whatever that was, though, might give us a clue on
            what’s going on.”
          </p>
          <p>“Yeah, I could bet on that part.”</p>
          <p>
            I think for a moment. “Hina may be right about the ‘First Maria’ thing, but…
            how did I put myself into that picture? I’m sure only the Grand Lady knows
            what was going on.”
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">Back at the castle…</p>
          <p>
            I was already in her room together with the Oujo-sama -- Hina. She appears to
            be distraught, and in some sort of confused state that I had to calm her down
            every few minutes. “Is everything alright?”
          </p>
          <p>“I’m good,” she said, calming down for a bit.</p>
          <p>Immediately, I pour a glass of water. “Here, drink this.”</p>
          <p>“Thanks,” she said as she gulped down the water. “I’m a little okay now.”</p>
          <p>
            “But, you need to rest,” I declare. “You’re not in a proper state to do
            anything, and we also need to prepare for your Coronation soon.”
          </p>
          <p>“Yeah, you’re right. But…”</p>
          <p>
            What came afterwards was a question that I didn’t expect to hear coming from
            her. Is she okay to ask me such a huge favor?
          </p>
