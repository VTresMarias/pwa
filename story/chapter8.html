        <div class="storyText">
          <p style="font-style: italic">A few hours later…</p>
          <p>
            I was accompanied to the dining room, which at a glance feels huge. I mean,
            look at the area of the room -- did you mistake that for half of the area of a
            decent house?
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, I sat next to Hina, with others on their respective chairs of
            choice. A meal was served: A hearty meal full of veggies and corn. I thought,
            “There’s no meat on the menu?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite that thought, the meal had been mostly uneventful; as we haven’t
            talked much about the delinquents, even more or less the circumstance of
            having the ‘Luna’ form. Hina looked at me carefully between each bite, though.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m not quite sure what her intention was, but let’s leave it at that for now,
            I guess.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">Back in the room…</p>
          <p>
            I was about to take a shower when I saw a bathrobe and some… bath salts? “Is
            there a hot spring somewhere in the castle?” I thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            I came out of the room with my clothes, but for some reason, Hina was
            accompanying me on our way to the hot spring. To be honest, I feel quite
            embarrassed about this.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Don’t worry about certain things, just try to treat it as a normal everyday
            activity that you always do,” she reassures, gazing at my face.
          </p>
          <p>
            I begin shying away. “But um, I’ve never been in a hot spring before. Not even
            back home.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The saddened Hina softly pats my head. “Don’t worry about it, you’ll be fine~”
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            We finally made it to the hot springs. Together with Hina’s help, I was able
            to pour the bath salts into the water.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hina went down first, and helped me do it too along the way. The servants
            began doing the work, having to clean as much as they could.
          </p>
          <p>I turned my gaze to Hina, who was sighing heavily.</p>
          <p>
            “You know, I don’t really worry much about what has happened over the last few
            months, but the last week has been pretty hectic. The Coronation ceremony was
            closing in, and I thought I won’t be able to make it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “What forced you to become the ruler, if you’re not up to the task anyways?” I
            asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            She shrugs slowly. “Was it because I made a promise to turn people&#39;s lives
            around? It would seem all but a pipe dream at one point.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “But still, you pushed through and almost became the ruler they all respect!”
          </p>
          <p>“Yeah.”</p>
          <p>
            “Look,” I pat her right arm. “I’ve never had any affairs with anything, but
            from my experience, I think it’s safe to say to at least try new stuff once in
            a while. Maybe there’s one hidden thing you’re always good at.”
          </p>
          <p>“I’m not entirely sure what to make of that, but…”</p>
          <p>
            “Look, someone out there might be rooting for you. You have to believe to
            understand that.”
          </p>
          <p>Hina smiles.</p>
          <p>
            “You know, I never once thought that someone that I was close to was rooting
            for me before you arrived. But, upon hearing about the circumstance from
            someone that told everything; she told me that if she can do something
            completely different, I can too.”
          </p>
          <p>“Someone?”</p>
          <p>She nods. “Yeah. They call her the ‘Grand Lady’ or some sort.”</p>
          <p>Immediately, I thought deeply about it. “The Grand Lady? Is that why…”</p>
          <p>“Um, are you thinking about her?” Hina leans in.</p>
          <p>
            I softly shriek, my gaze breaking away from hers. “No no no, it’s nothing.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Although I would figure the Grand Lady would be the brains of the whole
            operation,” I continued thinking deeply. “But, how would that concern me with
            Hina, and what is she implying here?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Hina smiles, the bath salts about to run out. “I guess that’s one sweet bath
            in the springs for now. Shall we go somewhere before we all take a rest?”
          </p>
          <p>
            I slowly nod, following her wherever she goes -- touring me around the castle.
            It got to the point that we got really tired on the trip, but that alone was
            worth it.
          </p>
          <p>I naturally smile as I gaze at her face. “I feel fulfilled.”</p>
          <p>
            “Glad you like it,” Hina pats my head. “We’ll have some important business
            tomorrow, so I’m hoping to get your input.”
          </p>
          <p>“No worries!”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            As we head ourselves to our beds, I begin to ponder about what has just
            happened over the past several hours. About the ‘Luna’ form that I
            inadvertently activated, as well as the interactions I had with Hina.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those thoughts made me feel sleepy, though, so I slept for the night
            afterwards.
          </p>
          <p>But at one point…</p>
          <p>
            The door slowly creaked open, a slender figure slowly wandering around on
            tiptoes. She appears to be distressed or concerned. This caused her to slide
            inside the blanket that I laid a few hours prior, as if wanting to have some
            company.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Her body must’ve felt so warm,” she said. I still slept soundly, so I
            didn&#39;t know what was going on around here until the moment I felt her
            hands placing on my waist.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that moment, I began struggling to get some sleep. I slowly turn, only to
            realize the fateful moment where it’s the same as the last time.
          </p>
          <p>“Hina?!” I shriek softly.</p>
          <p>
            Slowly, her eyes begin to open up as hers meet mine. With a concerned look on
            her face, she tightens her embrace. Her head on my chest, she begins to
            tremble.
          </p>
          <p>I can hear her murmur the following words:</p>
          <p>
            “Oh, Grand Lady… fate has led her to this place upon your request. In return,
            I promise to keep her safe as she’ll do the same.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Without any comprehension of the situation, I slowly put my hand on her head,
            giving a little pat. I gently smile, my bosom feeling the tears falling from
            her eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            But… it’s strange, given this situation at hand. How they could possibly deal
            with that sort is beyond me.
          </p>
          <p>
            But nevertheless, I tried my best to comfort her for the rest of the night,
            until…
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">The following morning…</p>
          <p>
            The sun shines through the window, cold air beginning to fill the room. Hina
            was still beside me, falling asleep. Her face shows that she’s smiling,
            though.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Good for you, I guess,” I smile, slowly pulling from her grasp as I head out
            to grab some food and coffee.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the kitchen, the chefs and maids are very hard at work. I observe from a
            safe distance as I prepare myself a nice cup of coffee. One maid joins in, and
            so is the other one.
          </p>
          <p>“What are you making?” Asks one maid.</p>
          <p>
            “Some coffee,” I answered. “Hold on -- what does Oujo-sama usually drink every
            morning?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “The same variant as yours,” The other maid nods. “Though it’s a bit creamier
            than it looks.”
          </p>
          <p>“Okay, I might need to train for this.”</p>
          <p>
            Following the maid’s instructions, I set out to make a best-looking creamed
            coffee. All hands on deck, the maids prepare the food to be assigned to the
            dining table.
          </p>
          <p>I follow suit, two cups in a tray.</p>
          <p>A while later, Hina came down, still a bit drowsy. “Good morning.”</p>
          <p>“Good morning,” the maids and I responded.</p>
          <p>
            Immediately, her nose started to react strangely. “What’s… what’s that nice
            smell? Wait, did I smell coffee?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Immediately rushing down the stairs, she grabs her mug from the table. “Who…
            who made this blend?”
          </p>
          <p>
            After hearing that, the maids began slipping away. I laughed nervously,
            looking at her enthusiastic face that already began to sparkle.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This is some nice blend you got there,” Hina beams at me. “How did you make
            this?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh, um,” I scratch my head, pointing to the slowly-fleeing maids. “The maids
            over there taught me how to make one.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I see,” she eyes the frightened maids. Instead of menacingly beaming at them,
            she slowly approaches them and gives each a soft pat on their heads. “Great
            work, you two.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “B- but,” stutters one of the two maids. “We didn’t tell you anything about
            it. Even though we want to sincerely apologize, there’s no questioning what
            we’re done.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Enough with those sappy apologies,” she asserts. “If it makes me happy, then
            you both did a great job.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Both of the maids began to wail as they were given much praise from Oujo-sama.
            Turning back her gaze to mine, she sips the coffee that I made. “This one… is
            the most delicious among everything that I’ve tried so far.”
          </p>
          <p>“I’m… very glad to hear that.”</p>
          <p>
            She nods, the guards escorting the wailing maids back to their quarters for
            examination because of what was going on earlier.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, one of the guards on patrol was looking for Hina. As he approached
            forward, he carried a letter in his right hand. “A message for Oujo-sama.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Thank you,” she said, taking the letter from the guard. She then carefully
            read the contents:
          </p>
          <div class="ltrBox">
            <p>≈≈≈</p>
            <div class="noteTxt">
              <p>Our Liege, the Oujo-sama:</p>
              <p>
                We are requesting your absolute appearance at the court following the
                delinquents’ assault towards the guards on patrol and an Important Guest
                of the Royal.
              </p>
              <p>
                Upon looking at the documents, we strongly request that the verdict
                against these adversaries be enacted immediately.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, we also request the presence of the guest involved, as she
                may provide us with additional evidence to support the claims presented by
                the plaintiffs.
              </p>
              <div class="noteClosing">
                <p>Judicial Committee</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>≈≈≈</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            “So, Agatha,” she said, looking at my gaze. “Guess it’s time to put these
            delinquents to justice.”
          </p>
          <p>A bit terrified, I nodded at her request.</p>
          <p>
            She then adds, “Let’s get dressed up immediately. We don’t want to cause the
            Judiciaries trouble.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Hastily, we all went back to our rooms after a quick coffee and shower. I
            somehow found a somewhat-regal dress that was lying around the bed when I
            headed back to my room. Looking at it, it adorned itself with poise royalty
            elements while retaining its original ‘red’ look and feel. The design feels
            rather reminiscent, and the palette on the sides were akin to popular designs
            that some of the world-famous designers use on their own.
          </p>
          <p>Oddly enough, it&#39;s also akin to most of my dresses.</p>
          <p>
            Immediately wearing the dress, I set off to meet Hina downstairs, where she
            enshrines herself in a completely regal look, but the design of her dress made
            it completely relevant to show her upper part of the abdomen. Nevertheless,
            it’s still pretty elegant by today’s standards because of its simplistic look.
          </p>
          <p>“Apologies for the wait,” she said. “Let’s get going.”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">At the Royal Court…</p>
          <p>
            “We would like to acknowledge the presence of our Liege, the Oujo-sama,
            accompanying her important guest who was involved in this case.”
          </p>
          <p>
            As the audience rose to their feet, Hina stood to the podium in full pride and
            dignity. I was accompanied by the guards as she ordered them to put me to her
            left side.
          </p>
          <p>
            “We’re here today to issue a verdict to these delinquents who have assaulted
            the guards around the gates’ perimeter yesterday. In addition, they have also
            assaulted one of the important guests who was supposed to arrive a few minutes
            before the incident happened. She’s currently safe as of now, but she will
            remain under my custody to allow her to recover from all those circumstances.
            In addition, she’ll be having her own perspective to what has happened, most
            of which have been briefed privately earlier.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, I did tell her what happened before we had gone back to sleep following
            the apparent ‘sleepwalk’ that she did last night. The trauma that I still had
            was still lingering.
          </p>
          <p>
            She firmly held my hand, whispering: “Don’t worry about anything else. Just
            tell them what you saw and experienced, and let the Judiciary assess the
            situation carefully.”
          </p>
          <p>I nod. “Okay then.”</p>
          <p>
            With every little courage I got, I immediately shared my own side of the story
            that I have told her. It was very pressuring, but I still appeared calm as she
            tightened her firm grip on my hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            I almost cried, but she patted my back as soon as my speech was done. “Please
            stay here while we reassess the case, so that you can witness how we handle
            things here,” she said, assuring my safety.
          </p>
          <p>
            All the while, I eyed on the delinquent who assaulted me earlier. I grit my
            teeth, wishing him the worst of his days as the Judiciary completes the
            verdict.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of them passes on the paper to Hina, as the audience wonders in silence.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            “We have assessed the case and the underlying situation,” said Hina as she
            read the passages from the paper that was submitted to her earlier. “The
            defendants have displayed a horrendous act that has put the lives of people
            involved at risk, and evidently coordinated attacks against an important
            guest. Such acts are straightforwardly punishable and therefore we issue the
            following verdict: The defendants are hereby declared…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Hina breathes deeply for a while, and glances at the delinquents. Then, she
            expresses her verdict in a serious tone, “GUILTY.”
          </p>
          <p>
            As the judge hammered the gavel down the table, he declared, “So ordered.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Hina then tells the guards on patrol: “Please ensure that the defendants can’t
            get away with what they’ve done to my precious guest.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “At ease, Oujo-sama,” they said as they accompanied the delinquents out of the
            courtroom, possibly heading for the dungeon entrance. But wait -- did Hina
            just call me her ‘precious guest’?
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hopefully this should put you at ease,” she said as she pats my back. “Do you
            have anything to say before we put them to their place?”
          </p>
          <p>
            I slowly nod despite being hesitant about the situation, letting Hina do the
            rest.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">A little later…</p>
          <p>
            Hina and I made it to the dungeon entrance, where the guards are waiting with
            the delinquents cuffed. “If you want to say some final words to them, go
            ahead,” she said.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eyeing at the delinquent from earlier, I couldn’t help but grit my teeth at
            his gaze. I could tell myself that I’m extremely angry at this point.
          </p>
          <p>
            Walking slowly towards the delinquent, a guard hands me a glass bottle. Then,
            I scream as I swing the bottle to his head, “How dare you get away with your
            shit! I hate you! Get away from me!!!”
          </p>
          <p>
            I repeatedly smash the bottle against him, not knowing that the bottle has
            already been broken. To everyone’s surprise, the delinquent was bleeding out
            from his face.
          </p>
          <p>
            I then add, “What you did to me came back to you. I hope you rot in there for
            eternity, asshole!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Fuming in anger, I inadvertently stomp the delinquent’s stomach with my high
            heels, letting him bleed for a moment. I then pull a piece of wood from the
            side, then whack at his chest many times as I have to.
          </p>
          <p>
            This left me exhausted after quite an ordeal, but seeing his blood-severed
            face gave me a sense of satisfaction, knowing that I have finally put him back
            to his place: At the bottom of the hierarchy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hina then ordered the guards to send the delinquents off to the dungeon for
            eternity, as I begin to pass out following the revenge.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">The next day…</p>
          <p>
            The morning sun has left me smiling as I get up from my bed. Surprisingly,
            Hina was beside me while I opened my eyes.
          </p>
          <p>“Good morning.”</p>
          <p>
            On the table were some meals for breakfast. Hina said, “This is my way of
            appreciating your presence here. It was pretty gruesome yesterday, so I’m sure
            you’re all worn out. Here -- I made you some breakfast.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “... thanks,” I answer aimlessly. “And sorry for what happened back there.”
          </p>
          <p>“It’s not your fault,” she reassures. “You did a great job back there.”</p>
          <p>
            We both smile, Hina carrying the tray to my bed. “Don’t do anything after
            this, just get some well-deserved rest. We’re going somewhere tomorrow.”
          </p>
          <p>“To where?”</p>
          <p>“You’ll see.”</p>
          <p>
            She left with a smile on her face, humming as she closed the door. I wonder
            what she was planning on taking me to as I indulge in the breakfast that she
            made just for me.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">Along the castle…</p>
          <p>
            A girl with yellow hair has been spotted along the corridors wearing some sort
            of a penguin hoodie. As Hina walks down the stairs, the girl follows through
            as silently as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I wonder where I should take her,” Hina thought as she carried a box back to
            her room.
          </p>
          <p>The girl looked puzzled as she wondered what was in the box.</p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, Hina, now back to her room, opens the box carefully. It contains
            not just two, but three bracelets of varying colors: Purple, green and pink.
            “What are these bracelets?” She thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            She also removes some sort of a photo frame from the box, as well as three
            pins with their respective color palettes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Puzzled, she chants her way to the sanctum where the Grand Lady lives and is
            currently tending to the Celestial Tree. “Grand Lady,” she called up to her.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hina,” the Grand Lady immediately stood, facing her direction. “What brings
            you here today?”
          </p>
          <p>
            She hands her a box. “What’s with the bracelets, a photo frame and three
            pins?”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Grand Lady smiles. “They will be revealed in due course, when the First
            Maria will then rekindle with your hearts forever.”
          </p>
          <p>“The… First Maria?”</p>
          <p>“You’ll see.”</p>
          <p>
            At this point, Hina somehow realizes that there’s something odd about the
            Royal Guest that she’s currently accompanying. The main question remains: Is
            the ‘guest’ the so-called First Maria?
