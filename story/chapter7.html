        <h2>Chapter 7: Luna</h2>
        <div class="storyText">
          <p>
            Together with the suitcase, I bid my goodbyes to the tenants at the boarding
            house as I make my way to the castle -- where the Ojou-sama was supposed to
            be.
          </p>
          <p>
            At a glance, I can see the carriage making its way to at least some directions
            away from me, but the driver doesn’t seem to know which boarding house was
            because a lot of them could well be akin to one. As such, the delays became
            imminent; I bet the Ojou-sama is growing upset by that point.
          </p>
          <p>
            I sigh, focusing my attention to the castle. I’m a number of steps away from
            the boarding house when a group of so-called ‘loyalists’ began talking to one
            another as they approached the same direction I walked. From there, I can hear
            some conversations about some of them planning to court the Ojou-sama, and one
            admitted to dreaming of fantasizing about her.
          </p>
          <p>“Gross,” I thought, my face irking in disgust.</p>
          <p>
            We walk on for quite a while until we can see a number of guards at the gate.
            Immediately, the group started to run as they approached the guards, begging
            for the Ojou-sama’s presence. The guards quickly apologized, reasoning that
            she was on a trip.
          </p>
          <p>
            I tried to stray away from the discussion by walking backwards, but I realized
            after turning around that the carriage had arrived at its destination -- the
            boarding house I previously sheltered in.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">At the boarding house…</p>
          <p>
            The Ojou-sama would then scramble in every room, searching for traces of her.
            She frantically asks the tenants there for any signs of a woman with green
            hair, but they all shook their heads.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I thought this was the place -- I mean, we all knew it was,” stammers the
            Ojou-sama, looking at every possible option.
          </p>
          <p>
            All while thinking about it, some of the active tenants have returned. “What
            seems to be the matter, Oujo-sama?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “To be honest, I’m quite confused at this point,” she sighs. “I thought she
            was still in here, so I came to get her.”
          </p>
          <p>“Oh,” realized one tenant. “You mean Agatha?”</p>
          <p>“Agatha?”</p>
          <p>
            “Yeah,” nodded another, showing a note to the Ojou-sama’s direction. “She just
            left some minutes ago.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon reading the note, she realized that the note was the exact copy that was
            sent to this property a few hours ago. “Um, can you tell me where she’s at
            right now?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Uh,” another murmurs. “She told us that she’ll be going to the castle after
            lunch, so she might have been there already.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Thanks so much,” the Ojou-sama bows immediately for a few times, then gets
            back to the carriage. Talking to the driver, she ordered, “Let’s head back to
            the castle.”
          </p>
          <p>“At ease, your Highness.”</p>
          <p>
            The carriage hurriedly huddles off, the Ojou-sama wondering how the woman
            named ‘Agatha’ was doing. “Is she gonna be alright?” She thought.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>“This is not good,” I mutter to myself.</p>
          <p>
            I got surrounded by the group that tried to break into the castle earlier
            because I was running away. They must have thought that whenever a passer-by
            walks in the same direction as theirs, they can interpret that as ‘a bystander
            being a secret accomplice’.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, I already told them I wasn’t going to the castle; but they
            immediately saw it as a complete lie. One had already punched me in the face,
            while the other snatched my suitcase and threw it to the side -- some parts of
            it had already been dented beforehand.
          </p>
          <p>“How cruel… !” I mutter to myself.</p>
          <p>
            But then, I got interrupted by a chant from the group, saying, “Cruelty is our
            middle name!”
          </p>
          <p>I gasp in anger. Just how crueler are these delinquents?</p>
          <p>
            The guards began to help ease the situation, but due to the strength of the
            delinquents, they were pushed and tossed aside. One of them started
            mercilessly pulling my hair, while the other began stomping my legs.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this point, trauma started to kick in, my arms trying to guard my torso as
            I cried endlessly. Yes… it was that ‘trauma’ that left me in worse condition
            back then.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">A long while ago…</p>
          <p>
            The Grand Lady and I were discussing my past, when I brought up that one time
            I got hurt pretty badly since childhood.
          </p>
          <p>
            “... and, when I was a mere eight year-old, I wasn’t prepared for all the
            suffering I had to go through. I was constantly ordered around to do chores
            both inside and outside the house. My parents only gave me praise when I did
            everything right, but their tone… it doesn’t seem like a praise at all. In
            some instances…”
          </p>
          <p>Tears began welling out of my eyes.</p>
          <p>
            “I was being beaten and berated without any reason, nor was there any reason
            for them to be angry at me. What did I do wrong to upset them in the first
            place?!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Continuing to tear up, the Grand Lady offered me a soothing sensation to ease
            my pain. But I kept on crying.
          </p>
          <p>“I don’t deserve this…”</p>
          <p>
            The Grand Lady slowly nods, a warm embrace engulfing my frail body. She begins
            to hum, a soothing song that puts me to sleep.
          </p>
          <p>
            A while later, she told me a little secret that she couldn’t hold much longer
            after listening to my story.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’m gonna give you something that will help you ease that pain. If you feel
            that same feeling as back then, call up to its name, and it will respond unto
            you.”
          </p>
          <p>“But,” I ask confusingly. “What ‘something’ is it?”</p>
          <p>
            “It’s a power that can overcome your fear. Call its name, and it will
            transform you to a being no man was capable of fighting up against.”
          </p>
          <p>I shriek. “What?!”</p>
          <p>
            “I know it’s hard to believe,” she pats my head. “But trust me: A name is all
            you can give.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Thinking about it, I kind of sensed that the supposed ‘power’ that she brought
            up was already swelling in my body -- waiting for its call.
          </p>
          <p>“Can I… test it here?”</p>
          <p>“Sure.”</p>
          <p>
            I took some deep breaths, and closed my eyes. In my concealed vision, I saw a
            future when a power can have the capability to change how others would see you
            as. The traumas, the circumstances, the achievements… everything.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh Luna, come to me.”</p>
          <p>
            As I mutter the sentence, I can feel my body heating up. My hair seemed to
            have changed its color, judging from the heat that came along with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, a gust had cleared. Standing next to the Grand Lady is a woman whose
            beauty defines the ‘Moon’. The so-called ‘Goddess of Moonlight’, if she can
            recall.
          </p>
          <p>
            She handed me a mirror. By appearance, I have an elegant dress which remotely
            resembles the dress Aura gave to me -- but it’s colored white. My hair is
            light peach to white and so were my eyes and cosmetics in general, a ring on
            my left finger, and a tiara on my head.
          </p>
          <p>
            She then brought a box which contained the moon-themed jewelry. “Please wear
            these.”
          </p>
          <p>
            After wearing them, I can see that the pendant on my necklace began lighting
            up. The Grand Lady declared, “Agatha, what you’re seeing right now is your
            ‘Luna’ form. That is, every time you call out to its name, your appearance
            changes -- making you feel like an actual goddess.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “This is madness,” I stammer, only to realize that my voice has been changed.
            It somehow felt like I have an even softer voice than usual, accompanied by an
            acapella in the background. When I realized, I covered my mouth in shock.
            “Wha… !”
          </p>
          <p>The Grand Lady softly smiles.</p>
          <p>
            In a moment, I begin to realize that the ‘Luna’ form that I was bestowed with
            was bigger than I thought. I deeply sigh, returning me back to normal through
            a shine of light.
          </p>
          <p>
            A moment later, the Grand Lady told me something important: “Now that you have
            obtained that Magnum Opus, I just want to remind you that you should only use
            it when you or someone special to you are in immediate danger. This form can
            be used for extended periods; but upon reverting back to normal, you must wait
            twelve hours before it can be reused again.”
          </p>
          <p>I nod, understanding the situation.</p>
          <p>
            The Grand Lady added, “But, if the situation gets even more haywire than it
            should be, the cooldown can be discarded at your will.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I see,” I nod in agreement. “This could be really interesting in the long
            run.”
          </p>
          <p>“It is.”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            As I’m still being kicked around by the delinquents and the guards trying hard
            to fend them off but to no avail, I slowly mutter the following words with
            tears in my eyes:
          </p>
          <p>“Oh Luna… please… come to… me…”</p>
          <p>
            Immediately, a blinding sight of white light begins to grow, engulfing the
            delinquents and the guards along with it. What I didn’t know, though, is that
            the light extended far beyond the proximity -- to the point that it affected
            even the bystanders from all areas, the tenants in the boarding house I
            previously reside in, and the carriage carrying the Ojou-sama and her
            accomplices with it.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            A moment later, the delinquents appear terrified. So did the guards on patrol.
          </p>
          <p>
            I look at my hands, and begin curling my hair. Seeing as the surroundings come
            to a standstill, I approach the delinquent who I remember kicking my face and
            stomach. I stare at him in a stern manner, more than enough to ‘traumatize’
            him from inside out.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Don’t show me your terrified face as an excuse for what you did to me a while
            ago. Even though I might not look like it, I can always remember almost
            everything that has happened. What you did to me is immeasurably unacceptable,
            and what you encouraged to your accomplices irks the hell out of me. Now what
            should I do to a cruel monster like you?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite merely apologizing, I scoff it off, the guards looking at me every few
            seconds as they grapple the other delinquents -- the latter appearing blinded.
          </p>
          <p>
            From afar, the Ojou-sama has just got out of the carriage just to witness a
            peculiar woman intimidating the delinquent as hard as she could. “Who’s that
            woman?” She thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the guards slowly approached my direction. “Um, ma’am… c- can you
            please put down the delinquent?” He asked.
          </p>
          <p>“I will. I’ll have some final words with him quickly.”</p>
          <p>
            Looking back at the delinquent, I parted some words: “Next time I find you
            trying to court the Ojou-sama again, you will regret it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I let go of my hand, letting the delinquent fall to his feet as the guard was
            waiting for him with a cuff on his hand. I immediately realize the immense
            feeling that I had in my ‘Luna’ form as I revert back to normal following a
            deep sigh.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can hear the Grand Lady in the back of my head, saying: “Don’t do things
            that will make you regret later on.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I turned around as the carriage had been parked to a safe distance. I can see
            the Ojou-sama accompanying her Royal Advisor as they encounter the delinquents
            being petrified. “What just happened back there?” The Royal Advisor asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the guards told them the whole story about the debacle, their
            intentions and what I did that somehow petrified them in their entirety.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was shocked, and so was the Ojou-sama who was about to write an order or
            some sort. “Here,” she gave it to him. “Tell the guards to meet me at the
            dungeon later.”
          </p>
          <p>
            As they affirmed the order and the delinquents being delivered to the dungeon
            as instructed, I set off to find the suitcase that they threw. Sure enough,
            one of the guards had it neatly placed beside the fence.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I think she’s the one,” the Ojou-sama thought, turning her head to the Royal
            Advisor. “Please give her one of my rooms when she gets back here. I’ll have
            to deal with some unfinished business and will meet her later.”
          </p>
          <p>“Affirm,” said the Royal Advisor. “But which room?”</p>
          <p>“Beside mine.”</p>
          <p>He nods. “At ease, your Highness.”</p>
          <p>
            The Ojou-sama hurries along to follow the guards as I return to where I
            previously stood. There, the Royal Advisor orders one of the guards to take my
            things. “Please guide her to the room requested by our Highness. And ma’am,
            Oujo-sama will be with you shortly.”
          </p>
          <p>“Oujo… sama?”</p>
          <p>He nods, “Our Highness, Hina Oujo. Everyone calls her Oujo-sama.”</p>
          <p>“That’s understandable. Let’s get inside the castle, then.”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">At the castle…</p>
          <p>
            Accompanied by the Royal Advisor, a guard, and some servants; we were standing
            at the door that leads to my supposed room. The guard turns the key open, then
            hands over to my direction. “Miss, the room is yours.”
          </p>
          <p>
            We headed inside the room, which was spacious -- a maximum of five people can
            stay here all at once. The servants proceed to occupy the cabinets and drawers
            with what’s within my suitcase.
          </p>
          <p>
            After they’re done, they allow me to rest for a moment. During that time I was
            completely baffled about what had just happened back there.
          </p>
          <p>“How did I blurt out that sentence?”</p>
          <p>
            Trying to remember about what just happened with the delinquents, it would
            seem that I was already in a peril when I blurted out the sentence.
          </p>
          <p>I thought to myself, “I need to see that scum of a delinquent.”</p>
          <p>
            “That won’t be necessary,” the woman said, though it was so sudden it caused
            me to shriek. “I’ve already set out a trial for tomorrow to throw the judgment
            above their heads.”
          </p>
          <p>“What? How did you know?”</p>
          <p>
            “Of course I know,” she smiles, her hands on her chest. “I won’t allow an
            individual like him to do any harm to my precious friend.”
          </p>
          <p>My eyes widened upon realizing what she said. “Your… precious friend?”</p>
          <p>
            “Let’s get to it straight. Your name is Agatha, correct?” She cuts to the
            chase, holding a pin of some sort.
          </p>
          <p>I nod. I thought, “How did she know my name?”</p>
          <p>
            She sits beside me, raising her hand in my direction. “It’s nice to finally
            meet you. My name is Hina. Hina Oujo.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Slowly, I followed suit, shaking hands with her for the first time. “Nice to
            finally meet you, Oujo-sama.”
          </p>
          <p>“You don’t have to call me that,” she blushes. “Just ‘Hina’ is fine.”</p>
          <p>“Um… okay then, Hina.”</p>
