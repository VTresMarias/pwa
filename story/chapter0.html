        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class="storyText">
          <p style="font-style: italic;">
            This is the continuation of the story from Mother (2019) by Horror Shop Games.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some years have passed since the demise of the revered Mother who had
            sacrificed her three children for food. Her body was all torn up in pieces,
            her clothing was worn out… but what remained untouched was her pristine hair
            -- which reminds that no matter what happens, her beauty is left unmatched.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before that, she took care of her four children in the midst of winter, where
            food is getting scarce by the moment. Realizing that, she took her children
            out to hunt for food, but the days ended with an empty stomach. With it, her
            sanity has dropped, and she is forced to make a risky decision -- too risky
            that the youngest child of them all decided to uncover the truth of the
            commotion.
          </p>
          <p>
            In turn, his intuitions came true -- the true personality of his Mother is
            revealed, and with it, the sacrifice of his last sibling. He decided to end it
            all -- death by a thousand cuts on rotary blades.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the end, spring has come and he’s finally free -- at the expense of his
            ‘cursed’ Mother.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, her body was still lingering at its wit’s end, trying to decay together
            with the house that she built upon with her sweetheart many years ago. Until…
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            A light began to shine around the labyrinth, its rays emanating around the
            distorted figure as it began to cleanse her inner soul. A few minutes later,
            the light vanishes.
          </p>
          <p>
            But something has happened inside the labyrinth -- the distorted figure is no
            more. Air began to seep in through the lungs, and the eyes were wide awake --
            the woman had finally woken up from her deathbed.
          </p>
          <p>“What… how could this happen? I was supposed to be dead already…”</p>
          <p>
            She could feel the pain tearing away, the wounds around her healing slowly
            until there was none. Alas, her former self has returned!
          </p>
          <p>“What am I doing here?”</p>
          <p>
            At a short moment, the light shone above her again, causing her to look back.
            “What just happened?” She asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            Appeared before her is an angel whose beauty has become the hope of all that
            follows her deeds. She has donned herself in a simple but elegant dress, a
            lovely flower tiara, and a pair of angelic wings as she glitters in her long,
            light-apricot hair. She softly answered, “I have decided to wake you up from
            your horrendous memory. Memories that have been bringing you down since then.”
          </p>
          <p>“But… I murdered my kids… for food…”</p>
          <p>
            “I understand the pain that you’ve gone through,” she said. “Even though
            they’re in heaven, they don’t regret calling you as their Mother whom they
            loved very much.”
          </p>
          <p>At this point, she began to cry, tears dripping down on her face.</p>
          <p>“Agatha…”</p>
          <p>
            Immediately, her eyes went up against the angel. “Your name is Agatha,
            correct?”
          </p>
          <p>
            She slowly nods after shedding the tears. “Yes… Mother Agatha. Who are you?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Please call me the Grand Lady,” she nodded. “I have given you a mission to
            change yourself for the better. A mission that will put you in a new light as
            you transform into someone that everyone will love in the end.”
          </p>
          <p>“But… how could I do that?”</p>
          <p>
            “You will need to find people who will truly care for you no matter what your
            circumstances are. The ones who will back you up, and never back down in a
            fight even if their own are in immediate dismay. The ones who will give you
            hope -- the light at the end of the tunnel. The ones where wits and
            personalities will give you something to ponder on for years to come.”
          </p>
          <p>“Could I… do that?”</p>
          <p>
            “I know you can, because you’re a loving Mother who can overcome just about
            anything.”
          </p>
          <p>“...”</p>
          <p>
            Slowly but immediately, the Lady’s Spirits appear around her, giving her a
            warm embrace. “We all believe in you,” they said. “You will hold the future to
            which the future generations will usher forward.”
          </p>
          <p>
            One by one, they slowly disappear. Then the Grand Lady uttered the final
            words, “May the spirit of the Luna, and the essence of the Celestial Tree, be
            with you forever.”
          </p>
          <p>
            With watering eyes, she set on to make a promise to herself: To reclaim the
            care that she once lost, to become the benefactor of the future generations,
            and to become one with those who cared for her the most.
          </p>
