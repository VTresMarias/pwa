        <h2>Chapter 11: Dress</h2>
        <div class="storyText">
          <p style="font-style: italic">Two days later…</p>
          <p>
            The Royal Advisor enters Hina’s room upon her request. “Preparations are
            nearly complete. Tomorrow will be your Coronation.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Very well,” Hina nods with a smile on her face. “I wonder, what would I call
            the subjects when the Coronation arrives?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I don’t know what to make of that, but it can be your personal preference,”
            he said. “Do you have anything on your mind?”
          </p>
          <p>“Hm.”</p>
          <p>
            Hina begins to think of a particular nickname for the subjects. She thought,
            “I think something cute may be nice, since my palette constitutes cuteness.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh I know,” she snaps her fingers. “Can you have Agatha in one of the gardens
            after the Coronation? I think I found the perfect nickname that will suit
            her.”
          </p>
          <p>“At ease, Oujo-sama.”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            I wander outside the castle, wearing one of the dresses I had in my wardrobe.
            For some reason, I realized that I have another pin placed beside the Lotus on
            its left. Again in colors of green and pink, it was a Sakura flower.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the guards -- in which I somehow remember from the time with the
            delinquents. I gave him a little wave from where I stood, in which he waved
            back with a smile on his face.
          </p>
          <p>“Glad he’s doing fine,” I thought.</p>
          <p>
            Immediately, I made my way upwards inside, where Hina and the maids were
            waiting for me. “Glad you had some fresh air,” she smiles. “The Coronation is
            tomorrow, so we’re gearing up the preparations to the max.”
          </p>
          <p>“Glad to hear that.”</p>
          <p>
            “Also, I personally requested the Royal Tailor to make you an elegant dress
            for the occasion. I hope you’ll like it.”
          </p>
          <p>“But, what about the dress from the other day?”</p>
          <p>
            “Call it a casual one,” she shrugs. “It’s somehow not intended for such
            important occasions, though.”
          </p>
          <p>“That’s fair.”</p>
          <p>“You can keep it, though,” she said with a grin. “I hope you’ll like it.”</p>
          <p>“Thanks!”</p>
          <p>
            At the moment, I didn’t know that Hina was looking at me with a smile on her
            face, the kind that makes one’s heart flutter. She seems to have bigger plans
            in mind.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">Later that evening…</p>
          <p>The Royal Advisor is in the room with me. “What brings you here, sir… ?”</p>
          <p>
            “Call me the Royal Advisor,” he said, carrying a large box. “Oujo-sama
            requested that I give the dress to you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I take the box from his hand. “I’m assuming the dress was the one she
            requested from the Royal Tailor, correct?”
          </p>
          <p>“Yes, it would seem.”</p>
          <p>
            “Thanks,” I said as I unboxed the royal garments to be used for tomorrow. By
            appearance, it was adorned in shades of pink and green. The frills were
            covered in glitter and fur, and the skirt was shaded in black.
          </p>
          <p>“But… what’s so special about this?” I thought.</p>
          <p>
            Inside the box, however, there’s a note which I can recognize as Hina&#39;s
            handwriting. It says:
          </p>
          <div class="ltrBox">
            <p>≈≈≈</p>
            <div class="noteTxt">
              <p>Agatha,</p>
              <p>
                I hope you like the new dress! I’m actually a bit worried since the Royal
                Tailor told me earlier that when he’s about to finish the dress, it
                appears to be already finished together with a note attached to it.
              </p>
              <p>
                It reads that “as soon as the Coronation ends, something special will
                happen to the dress”.
              </p>
              <p>
                To be honest, I’m kinda scared about what will happen, but let’s hope it’s
                not what I thought it would be.
              </p>
              <p>But still, you can choose to keep the dress if you want to.</p>
              <div class="noteClosing">
                <p>Hina</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>≈≈≈</p>
          </div>
          <p>“Well,” I blurt out. “There’s no harm in trying, right?”</p>
          <p>
            Together with some courage, I finally let out a sigh as I tried to put the
            dress on. “Let’s see what happens on Coronation Day.”
          </p>
