        <h2>Chapter 18: Crown</h2>
        <div class="storyText">
          <p>
            At the Incorporeal Garden, at the Fun House, Aura has just been given
            additional powers that will aid in her quest to find her long-lost friend.
          </p>
          <p>“Agatha, we’ll meet again,” she said to herself.</p>
          <p>
            Just then, she heard a sudden thud from what’s supposed to be Agatha’s room.
            Heading to the source of the noise in a hurry, she opened the door only to
            find there’s no one there.
          </p>
          <p>Just around the floor, however, she saw a mysterious box.</p>
          <p>“I could’ve sworn there wasn’t a box in here before, was there?”</p>
          <p>
            Carefully, she walks forward to grab the box from its position, and heads
            away. Sighing in relief, she walks over to one of the tables to have a look at
            the mystery box.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unknowingly, she felt a note inside the box. Pulling it out, it displayed the
            following:
          </p>
          <div class="ltrBox">
            <p>≈≈≈</p>
            <div class="noteTxt">
              <p>The First Maria is waiting for you.</p>
            </div>
            <p>≈≈≈</p>
          </div>
          <p>“The… First Maria?”</p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, a familiar face walks inside the house. “That’s right. The time is
            almost here.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Wait,” she immediately looks upward, realizing a familiar voice. “Grand Lady?
            What are you doing here?”
          </p>
          <p>
            She taps her right shoulder. “The Third Maria has realized who she was. You
            know what I mean.”
          </p>
          <p>“Do you mean… ?”</p>
          <p>
            In another moment, another person steps inside the house. She seems to be
            royally-clothed, by the look of it. “Um, who are you?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “My name is Hina,” she bows. “Hina Oujo. I came here on behalf of the Grand
            Lady.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Grand Lady nods in response. “Aura Ostara. I brought her here because she
            has something important to say to you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “At ease,” Hina walks forward, holding what seems to be the same box Aura got
            -- but in a different color. “Aura, I just realized that we’ve been called by
            the Grand Lady for one thing in common: Someone precious to us.”
          </p>
          <p>“Someone… precious to us?”</p>
          <p>
            “Do you mean,” Hina puts the box on the table. “A woman with green hair? Red
            dress?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Now that you mention it, I encountered her before,” Aura nods in realization.
            “Though I only remember that she wanted her hair green to match mine, I guess.
            But the dress? Hold on.”
          </p>
          <p>Hina smiles, and so is the Grand Lady.</p>
          <p>
            Immediately, she stopped as she saw the memories being played back in her
            eyes. “Hold on -- Hina, did you address her by any unique means?”
          </p>
          <p>Hina nods. “I call her Aga-chuu.”</p>
          <p>
            “Aga-chuu,” Aura tries to distinguish the nickname in her head. “Aga-chuu…”
          </p>
          <p>Immediately, her eyes begin to widen. “Agatha?!”</p>
          <p>
            Hina smiles in response. Aura adds, “How would she do that? And how would
            these boxes lead us to her?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “You see, the boxes and the fact that both of you are in presence with each
            other plays a role,” cues the Grand Lady. “But only she has the ‘key’ to make
            it happen.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “And by key, you mean, only Aga-chuu gets to spill us the details?” Asks Hina.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Grand Lady nods in response. “Yes. In a few moments, she’ll wake up in
            another world -- a world where both of you were expected to meet her for the
            first time together.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Aura still has no idea what all of this is about, but her mind has been made
            up. “Okay, I’ll believe in what you said this time. For the sake of rekindling
            with her once more.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “You can do that,” smiles the Grand Lady. “But you can stay with her forever
            if you so desire.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Aga-chuu,” chants Hina, her hands clasped against one another. “We’re coming
            to meet you again.”
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>“Mother Agatha, the First Maria; the floor is yours.”</p>
