        <h2>Chapter 16: Nurse</h2>
        <div class="storyText">
          <p>“I haven’t seen Suzu,” a maid told me.</p>
          <p>“Neither am I,” another had the same experience.</p>
          <p>
            It’s been two days since Suzu told me about becoming my acquaintance, and I
            myself had learned about her future plans. But I decided not to tell the maids
            and others about it because it’s a secret between her and I.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">Rewind…</p>
          <p>
            Suzu and I are at one of Hina’s Cherry Blossom gardens along the castle.
            Facing my direction, she slowly pulls her hat from her head; revealing the top
            part of her hair.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’ve decided that I should change how I look before I can meet you again,”
            Suzu said. “And also, I’m planning on changing my name to reflect that sort.”
          </p>
          <p>“I see,” I nod. “But, how would you do that?”</p>
          <p>“I got a plan.”</p>
          <p>
            Relaying her plans to me, she continued, “Promise me to not tell the others
            about this secret.”
          </p>
          <p>“I won’t.”</p>
          <p>“Good.”</p>
          <p>
            Slowly, a portal opens behind her, gently pulling air in. “I have to go, I’ll
            meet you soon.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I waved goodbye as she stepped into the portal, with me having no idea where
            that portal leads to. But I’m seeing long strands of golden hair along its
            horizon.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I was about to leave, a note was kept on a table. Picking it up, it
            revealed the following message:
          </p>
          <div class="ltrBox">
            <p>≈≈≈</p>
            <div class="noteTxt">
              <p>Our paths will cross soon.</p>
              <p>Don’t forget it.</p>
              <div class="noteClosing">
                <p>King Arthur</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>≈≈≈</p>
          </div>
          <p>“What?” I gasp, making a confused face. “Who’s… King Arthur?”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            I still have the note from when the portal was about to close behind my back.
            Looking at it from Hina’s room, I still can&#39;t distinguish who King Arthur
            is, and how he explicitly tells me about ‘crossing paths’.
          </p>
          <p>“Something’s fishy here.”</p>
          <p>
            Somehow, I got a call from the telephone line. I didn’t know that that was
            there until Hina toured me around during her time here.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carefully accepting the call, it somehow sounds like a high-pitched, ‘cutesy’
            voice. “Um, who am I speaking to?”
          </p>
          <p>
            The line went quiet for a bit, but retrieved with a rather unsettling feeling.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s Hina.”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            There’s this one clinic beyond the kingdom which houses what they call the
            ‘Angelic Neko Nurse’. While she gives prescriptions during the day, she
            cuddles one’s soul at night.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of those who claimed to have seen her have been experiencing comfort day
            in and day out. Out of all the nurses in the facility, she stood out among the
            rest.
          </p>
          <p>Her name… is Hina. Hina Sukii.</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            But I’ve known this fact that when I heard the name ‘Hina’ it stuck with me as
            having just one Hina in the field.
          </p>
          <p>Nevertheless, she slowly continues the sentence:</p>
          <p>“Aga-chuu, I’m home~”</p>
          <p>
            Slowly, I can feel my tears falling from my eyes. Sure, she did change her
            pitch and style, but I can tell that this is still the same Hina that I met
            for the first time!
          </p>
          <p>“Hi- Hina!”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">The next day…</p>
          <p>
            I’m on Hina’s bed when I heard someone hum. Slowly, I opened my eyes, only to
            find someone familiar sitting on the side of the bed. “Hina?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Shh! Keep quiet,” she said in a soft tone. “I don’t want to attract any
            attention for now.”
          </p>
          <p>“But,” I try to get up. “How did you get here?”</p>
          <p>She turns around, a key dangling from her hand. “I still have it.”</p>
          <p>I smile. “I see. Welcome home, Hina.”</p>
          <p>
            By appearance, she dons a quite revealing outfit colored pink. She has a
            collar belt around her neck, with a cat pendant attached to a chain. She has a
            hat resembling her profession as a nurse, while her face resembles a nekomimi
            -- a catgirl. Observing her from top to bottom, she also has a number of
            bandages around her body.
          </p>
          <p>
            We both smile in delight, her changing topic a moment later. “You know, it’s
            hard having to keep up with everything that has happened around here.
            Especially when I’m now like this.”
          </p>
          <p>“Did you get reincarnated or something?”</p>
          <p>“Perhaps.”</p>
          <p>“I see. How long will you be able to maintain that form?”</p>
          <p>
            “To be honest with you, I’m not sure when. Though I like this look, I kinda
            missed the old one… the one that I wore when I first met you here.”
          </p>
          <p>“Yeah… brings back old memories.”</p>
          <p>
            After a brief silence, I managed to get up to sit beside her. Sighing, we both
            look at the window as we witness the sun shining above.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You know, it got me thinking,” Hina gazes to my direction. “I could’ve wished
            that I never left this kingdom in the first place… I felt empty back home
            without your hugs. You know, I may be known for giving hugs and kisses in
            their sleep; but deep inside, I feel lonely and frail.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Without hesitation, I responded with a soft embrace. I can feel her tears
            seeping through my arms as I stroke her head. This continued on for several
            minutes until she calmed down.
          </p>
          <p>
            The months that follow were uneventful, but during those times I’ve been
            wondering if I’m capable enough to be able to run the kingdom in her place.
            Those thoughts continued to seep in, that it concerned the Royal Advisor.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You seem to be devastated,” he told me. “Are you worried about what happened
            to Oujo-sama?”
          </p>
          <p>I nod slowly. “Looks like it.”</p>
          <p>
            “I see,” he said, writing a note on a piece of paper. One of the maids stepped
            in, receiving the note. “Go tell the Royal Messenger that the Overseer will be
            looking out for everyone in the kingdom moving forward,” he ordered.
          </p>
          <p>Such a sentence made me shriek.</p>
          <p>“What? I, um…”</p>
          <p>
            “We’ll help you should you need one,” he reassures, patting my head. “You’ve
            done a lot of things for Oujo-sama and the rest of us, so please allow us to
            return the favor.”
          </p>
          <p>I can feel my eyes pouring out tears.</p>
          <p>
            He adds, “I’m sure this is what the Oujo-sama wished in the first place before
            she was crowned the Queen, to have someone like you to look out for everyone.
            I can still remember that day she told me a week before you arrived.”
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">Rewind…</p>
          <p>
            The Royal Advisor entered Hina’s room upon her request, sitting beside her.
            “Oujo-sama, what do you need?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Um, it’s nothing special, really,” she smiles, gazing at the floor. “But, I
            just had a dream last night.”
          </p>
          <p>“Sounds wonderful. So, what dream was it?”</p>
          <p>
            She sighs, telling the story. “So, I dreamed of meeting someone for the first
            time. From the get-go I can see that she’s good at everything she does. We
            bonded with each other, made amends; and most importantly, she became one of
            the most important people to me.”
          </p>
          <p>“That sounds lovely.”</p>
          <p>
            “I also remember in that dream that I made her a part of the household, so
            that she can work together with others of similar aspects. And at one point, I
            asked her a favor if she could look out for the subjects while I’m away.”
          </p>
          <p>“Oh?”</p>
          <p>
            “So, I say this,” commanded Hina, who was writing a note. “Should the
            situation arise and I departed for a very long time, tell her everything I
            told you. And issue a directive to have her take over my place.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Eh?” He sounded shocked. “Would that be risky? What if she didn’t turn out
            the way you wanted to be?”
          </p>
          <p>
            She just smiles, being optimistic about the situation. “I’m sure she’ll turn
            out okay.” She adds, her hands on her chest, “I can feel her spirit revolving
            around the virtue of goodwill in her heart, so I have nothing to worry about.”
          </p>
          <p>“Okay,” he scratched his head. “Have you figured out the name?”</p>
          <p>
            She sighed for a bit, then gave him the name that he didn’t expect to hear
            from her.
          </p>
          <p>“Mother Agatha. Aga-chuu.”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">Two weeks later…</p>
          <p>
            I’m at the clinic that Hina currently works at. One of the staff told me that
            she’s currently sick, so she can’t serve everyone well.
          </p>
          <p>
            But upon discretion, I was able to get into the room where she currently stays
            for the time being. “Hina,” I called up to her with a hoarse voice.
          </p>
          <p>“Aga-chuu… is that you?”</p>
          <p>I nod, slowly walking towards her. “Yes… it’s me.”</p>
          <p>
            “I should’ve known that I made the right choice to be right next to you that
            day,” she said. “I know it’s been a rough time, but when I’ll be taking a rest
            for a long time, I’ll leave everything to you.”
          </p>
          <p>“You mean…”</p>
          <p>“I think the Royal Advisor told you everything you need to know.”</p>
          <p>
            Remembering what he told me, tears flow on my cheeks as I firmly hold her
            hands. “Hina-chuu, I will never forget the day that you offered me a place to
            stay. It’s been a painful journey, but I know that we’ve been able to see the
            most precious moments together.”
          </p>
          <p>“I’m glad to hear that,” she smiles calmly. “How is Suzu?”</p>
          <p>
            “She’s good,” I nod. “But I don’t know where she is right now. She seems to
            have wandered around somewhere, I guess.”
          </p>
          <p>“I see. She must’ve headed for Erden.”</p>
          <p>“Erden?”</p>
          <p>
            Letting go of my grip, she reaches out to the cabinet to snag a letter,
            handing it to my direction. “Someone named King Arthur sent this to me.”
          </p>
          <p>“Oh wait.”</p>
          <p>“Do you know her?”</p>
          <p>“I guess.”</p>
          <div class="ltrBox">

            <div class="noteTxt">

          </div>
          <p>“Emii? Who?”</p>
          <p>
            “I don’t know,” she said. “But if this came from King Arthur, it would appear
            that he did something to her. Someone whom we both cherished.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “To be honest, I’m still not quite sure whether or not it would make a
            difference, but I’ll keep an eye out.”
          </p>
          <p>“Thanks. And tell Suzu or Emii I said hi.”</p>
          <p>“So, what are you going to do now? You’re gonna be here for a while?”</p>
          <p>
            Hina gazes at the ceiling. “Yeah, I think. Look, this may sound like I don’t
            have anything left to say, but I need to formally thank you for everything
            that you did to the kingdom. Part of me has been contemplating things that
            might interfere with my decisions, but I think it’s for the best. You have
            proven yourself to be above all else, so I would consider leaving everything
            to your regard.”
          </p>
          <p>“That’s… a huge responsibility.”</p>
          <p>
            “It sure is, but I’m sure you can do it. After all, you’re the first person
            that I met that exceeded what I wished and hoped for.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Hearing those compliments made me wail on her arms, thanking her for what she
            did to me during my stay. “I promise that I’ll be doing whatever I can to
            preserve your legacy and lead everyone to a bright new future.”
          </p>
          <p>“Now usher on,” Hina ordered. “The people awaits your call.”</p>
          <p>
            I nodded, and hurriedly left the clinic. Back at the room, Hina gazes at the
            door with a final smile on her face.
          </p>
          <p>“May the Chuu-nins be with you, our First Maria.”</p>
