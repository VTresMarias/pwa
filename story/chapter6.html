        <h2>Chapter 6: Paths</h2>
        <div class="storyText">
          <p>
            As I make my exit from the Incorporeal Garden, I look around to see the Grand
            Lady standing under the tree.
          </p>
          <p>“Grand Lady,” I called up to her, running towards her direction.</p>
          <p>She waves her hands in the air. “Agatha, you came at a perfect time.”</p>
          <p>“Probably.”</p>
          <p>“So,” cues the Grand Lady. “How’s it going with Aura?”</p>
          <p>
            I chuckle. “It was… unexpected. I never knew that the friendship I had with
            her from her previous life had stayed with her even now. I can’t believe that
            the friend I thought I lost over some accident was right before me -- crying
            while waiting for my call.”
          </p>
          <p>“That must be lovely to see.”</p>
          <p>“I mean,” I chuckle. “You saw it all, didn’t you?”</p>
          <p>“You got me.”</p>
          <p>
            Holding an envelope, the Grand Lady changes her tone. “Agatha. You have
            successfully rekindled with your first friend whom you loved dearly, and she
            began to feel the same about you. That confirms that you have the capability
            to love and be loved again -- regardless of what the negativities tell you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Is… that so?” I contemplate. A while later I glance at the envelope she’s
            holding. “What’s that you’re holding?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Immediately, she hands it over to my direction. “Here, it’s an invitation.”
          </p>
          <p>“Invitation for what?”</p>
          <p>
            She smiles chalantly. “A Royal Coronation will be held in a few days from now.
            Someone will be ruling the kingdom.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’ve…” I shy away. “I’ve never been to a Coronation, unfortunately. Not even
            once.”
          </p>
          <p>“Then this will give you a chance,” she smiles.</p>
          <p>
            I tilt my head. “Problem is, though: Who gave you the envelope? And how did
            you know I will be going?”
          </p>
          <p>“Actually…”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">A while ago…</p>
          <p>
            The Grand Lady had just finished tending the Celestial Tree when Hina came to
            the sanctum. “Grand Lady!”
          </p>
          <p>“Hina,” she greets with a smile. “What’s with that envelope?”</p>
          <p>
            Handing the envelope, Hina replies, “I hope I spelt your friend’s name right.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Aww, thanks,” the Grand Lady chuckles as she takes a peek at the contents.
            “I’ll send it to her when I meet her in a few days.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “And,” Hina hands over a pot of some sort. “Can I have the Sakura sapling?”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Grand Lady nods, placing a bag of seeds over it. “You can have these seeds
            right away. I’ll prepare a sapling for you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            After a while, she returns with a sapling in a specially-crafted planter. “You
            can keep this.”
          </p>
          <p>“Really?”</p>
          <p>The Grand Lady nods, looking at her beaming face.</p>
          <p>“I better go now, before anyone starts acting suspicious once again.”</p>
          <p>“I’ll help you with what you’re carrying.”</p>
          <p>
            Hina immediately declines the offer. “Thanks, but I need to do this alone. I
            can’t risk putting you in more trouble than what we had dealt with before.”
          </p>
          <p>“Okay,” the Grand Lady nods. “Get home safe.”</p>
          <p>“I will~”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>Despite my speculations, I took the envelope from her. “Okay, I’ll go.”</p>
          <p>“Good,” the Grand Lady beams happily. “I assume you’re ready to go.”</p>
          <p>“Um, where are you taking me to?”</p>
          <p>
            “To the kingdom indicated in that invitation,” she nods. “There, you will meet
            with the Ojou-sama who will assist you with everything you need.”
          </p>
          <p>“I assume the mission will be the same as always?”</p>
          <p>She slowly nods. “Yes, but what you’ll do is up to you.”</p>
          <p>I nod. “Okay, lead the way.”</p>
          <p>“It’s settled, then.”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            A portal whooshes before me, the Grand Lady smiling softly behind my back.
            “The kingdom awaits your presence, Agatha.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Determined, I take a deep breath before stepping into the portal, feeling the
            sudden rush of wind on the other side. “It’s windy here,” I thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            But as soon as I finally finished setting foot on the other side, the portal
            vanished immediately -- leaving only the surroundings behind. I’m in the
            middle of the road?!
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, the Grand Lady sighs upon seeing the portal go. “Agatha… the Third
            Maria is waiting for you.”
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            Immediately rushing to the sidewalk, I can see the castle from afar. “But
            where’s the Coronation ceremony going to be held?” I thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            At a glance, there’s a boarding house that seems to be cozy inside. I
            immediately settle for a bit, hoping to be warm after the chill of what’s on
            the other side of the realm.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">The next day…</p>
          <p>
            “Oujo-sama,” one of the maids came in. “The carriage is ready for a parade.”
          </p>
          <p>The Ojou-sama rushes to finish dressing up. “Coming!”</p>
          <p>
            Immediately coming down, a lovely carriage was waiting at the front. The
            driver patiently waits for the Royalty to enter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon doing so, the driver signals his horse to wander around town, so that the
            Ojou-sama can see what her subjects and commoners are up to.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon realizing that the Royalty had arrived, everyone began cheering from the
            side. Men, women, and children were all supporting her as the carriage rode
            along with the Ojou-sama waving her hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, I still feel sleepy as I get out of the boarding house to see what
            the fuss is about. The cheering made it almost impossible to comprehend, but I
            was able to slide along to the side. From afar, I can see the carriage almost
            turning and heading in this direction.
          </p>
          <p>Despite everything, I still have the envelope.</p>
          <p>
            The carriage closes in as I patiently wait. From inside the carriage, I can
            see a face behind a glass panel, with one hand waving about.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the carriage passed on, the Ojou-sama and I’s eyes met. From the look of
            it, she somehow had that kind of smile that encompasses me to the point that I
            almost fainted.
          </p>
          <p>
            But her smile immediately turns into concern as the gaze subsides.
            Immediately, she orders the driver to stop the carriage as she orders her
            Royal Advisor to wait inside. She got out of the carriage, only to find that I
            was no longer where I stood -- I went back to the boarding house.
          </p>
          <p>“So that was you, Agatha.”</p>
          <p>
            After that event, I was in the middle of cooking some lunch for the tenants
            when one of them barged into the kitchen. “Agatha, you got a letter from the
            Ojou-sama.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hold on,” I stammer as I prepare another plate to serve the last dish. “Wait
            for me at the dining table.”
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">A while later…</p>
          <p>
            “The Ojou-sama wants to see you,” I blurted as I read the letter out loud.
            “Does that mean she wants to see me?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “It would appear so,” one of the tenants agreed. “I saw her when she came down
            from the carriage, but she has this kind of concern on her face. Did you do
            something?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Not that I consider it concerning for the general public,” I shrug. “But
            whatever the deal is, I’ll be there after this.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Yeah, you need to be full in order to be energized,” another smiles. “Let’s
            dig in!”
          </p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">At the castle…</p>
          <p>
            “Has she arrived yet?” The Ojou-sama asked the Royal Advisor. He shook his
            head.
          </p>
          <p>
            She sighs. “Okay, get the carriage going to that boarding house. I’ll brief
            her about what to do next.”
          </p>
          <p>
            She hopes that this will be the last straw against waiting for the opportunity
            to arrive. What could she be planning?
          </p>
          <p>
            And how would I get involved in a situation that should be destined for a
            Royalty like her?
