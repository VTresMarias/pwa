          <b>「VTresMarias - V三人のマリア - 」</b> was provisioned through a fanart from
          thebelovedmoon (the First Maria🍃) last 27 Dec 2022 as his way of appreciating
          his fellow VTubers -- Aura Ostara (the Second Maria🪷) and Hina Oujo (the Third
          Maria🌸).
        </p>
        <p>
          this VTuber Collective has become the basis for the continuous support of the
          Marias throughout their VTubing career -- even beyond their hiatus.
        </p>
        <p>
          in terms of lore, the Marias' story is culminated -- with the majority being
          the First Maria🍃's as it encompasses on how she was able to overcome the
          challenges to complete her underlying mission.
        </p>

        <h3>Mother Agatha, the First Maria🍃</h3>
        <p>
          Mother Agatha was once a beloved Mother before everything fell apart due to
          the brink of winter. she was given a mission from the Grand Lady upon her
          resurrection to find those who will be a part of her life forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          behind the character is thebelovedmoon -- also known as 💚🍃Aga-chuu💗🌸 --
          the founder of this VTuber Collective. he initially used this within the
          Horror Shop Games community, but this has evolved over using it as his VTuber
          presence in order to represent such community.
        </p>
        <p>
          he specializes in graphics and PR, as well as websites and programming. his
          current ventures (alongside this) include #MamaNyoSquad, ReactSquad, and
          AgaASMR (aka Aga&#39;s ASMR Garden).
        </p>

        <h3>Aura Ostara, the Second Maria🪷</h3>
        <p>
          Aura Ostara represents the Celestial Nymph Guardian who aims to protect her
          Nimbisouls by all means necessary. she was an everyday girl before that one
          moment changes her life forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          behind the character, she is a lively VTuber who dreams to connect with
          everyone that she meets throughout the way. she mostly streams Magicka and
          Mario Kart, but she also hosts zatsudan whenever she has time.
        </p>
        <p>
          as of 19 Oct 2022, she&#39;s currently on indefinite hiatus; and the future
          remains uncertain upon her return to her VTubing career.
        </p>

        <h3>Hina Oujo, the Third Maria🌸</h3>
        <p>
          Hina Oujo is an elegant queen from a faraway land who vows to serve her
          Chuu-nins well. she has everything under her disposal, but deep inside, she
          needs someone who will make her feel whole after what seems to be her whole
          heap of loneliness.
        </p>
        <p>
          behind the character, she&#39;s formerly known as Suzu Puyotori and HinaSukii
          -- where the former has renamed to Emii Shion. she&#39;s a talented artist who
          has made waves over X before she debuted 3 Jul 2022. she typically enjoys art
          and zatsudan, and majorly plays League of Legends and Apex Legends -- among
          other things.
        </p>
        <p>
          as of 28 Jan 2024, she has decided to put everything behind as her socials are
          closed -- forever. but her soul will always stay with the Collective for the
          sake of the future. 💗the Third Maria will always stay with us forever.🌸
        </p>

        <h2>our Core Values</h2>
        <h3>「Universality without Borders」</h3>
        <p>
          our primary aim is to be open to all walks of life, whether it would be behind
          the screen or in front of a real person.
        </p>
        <p>
          we do not permit any forms of negativity within our community and beyond. we
          strive to protect and support each other through trying times and not bring
          them down.
        </p>
        <h3>「Acceptance without Comprehension」</h3>
        <p>
          accompanying our aim for universality is our advocacy to accept everyone&#39;s
          flaws. our community strives on making sure everyone is widely accepted
          regardless of their nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          but in order to maintain that acceptance, we have put additional measures to
          further strengthen our bond and to stay true to our promise of uniting the
          communities together as one.
        </p>
